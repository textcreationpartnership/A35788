            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ove is a cloſe and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Inſinuator, and finds ſuch hidden and ſecret ways of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that no Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Auſterity can be ſo ſecure; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Maxims fortifie a Heart, there will till remain ſome weak and defenceleſs approaches, at which, he will force an entrance.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94436:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Solon,</hi> that famous <hi>Athenian,</hi> the moſt renowned of the <hi>Seven Wiſemen,</hi> and the Law-giver of his Countrey, in vain ſought amongſt his Laborious Employs, a Sanctuary againſt Love: His continual cares for the Glory of <hi>Athens,</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in War, and his Studies in Peace, could not protect him from the aſſaults of this Paſſion. He derived his Pedigree from <hi>Codrus,</hi> one of the Firſt Kings of <hi>Attica:</hi> The endowments of his Mind, correſponded well with ſo illuſtrious a <hi>deſcent,</hi> but Fortune contributed not to the ſupport of its ſplendor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euphorion,</hi> Father to this <hi>Hero,</hi> had been ſo bountiful of his goods, where he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them wanting, that he had ſcarce left ſufficient for himſelf. <hi>Solon</hi> who would have uſed the ſame liberality, had he been in his Fathers place, would not now permit indigency to defraud him of the practiſe of it; he made his Induſtry his Exchequer, and ſeeking among ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers what he could no longer find at home, was ſo happy in his Voyages, and his Undertakings were all ſo ſucceſsful, that he returned to <hi>Athens</hi> with a greater Revenue then his Father had conſumed. Whatever <hi>Philoſophers</hi> may think fit to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94436:3"/>tell us, Riches are the main Pillars and Arches of Credit and Authority. <hi>Solon</hi> was ſcarce taken notice of whilſt Fortune ſeemed to frown; he was raiſed to the higheſt charges in the Commonwealth, as ſoon as ſhe began to ſmile. There was now an obſtinate War between the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the People of <hi>Megara,</hi> about the Iſland <hi>Salamina,</hi> both Cities pretended its dependance on them; the <hi>Athenians</hi> founded their right on Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Philaeus</hi> and <hi>Euriſaces,</hi> Sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jax,</hi> being made Citizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> had given the Iſland of <hi>Salamina</hi> to that Commonwealth, in token of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. The <hi>Megarians</hi> were powerful in Men and Money: Power is often a valuable title, and <hi>Salamina</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to them. The <hi>Athenians</hi> feared them, and believing it ſweeter to live voluptuouſly within their Walls, then to extend their Dominions at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their Peace and Pleaſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that <hi>Salamina</hi> ſhould be left to the <hi>Megarians. Piſiſtratus,</hi> one of the richeſt Men amongſt them, encouraged them in this reſolution; he aſpired to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority, and judged it would be eaſier to reduce to obedience, People
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94436:4"/>ſoftned by Pleaſures and Idleneſs, then Men grown warlike, and accuſtomed to fights.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> had many great Talents to make himſelf be beloved, He was young, handſome, and of a ſweet and flattering Spirit. <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no recommendable quality, but that he could not confine himſelf to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a private Citizen. The young men and populacy, ſupported all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; but <hi>Solon</hi> was ſupported by a power that never found any thing could reſiſt it: He had in his Travels ſojourned ſome time in <hi>Salamina,</hi> and there fell in love with <hi>Orgina,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicles,</hi> who then governed that Iſland; but there was a clauſe in the Laws of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> the firſt Lawgiver among the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> forbidding any deſcended from the Royal Stock, to ally themſelves with any other but <hi>Athenians,</hi> or, at leaſt, People reputed to belong to <hi>Attica. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamina</hi> muſt then be made one of the Members of <hi>Athens,</hi> to Authoriſe the Love of <hi>Solon.</hi> He ſummons all his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the relief of his Love, and if the faction of <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, <hi>Solons</hi> had the more Authority.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94436:4"/>It was concluded, <hi>Salamina</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and <hi>Solon</hi> was made General in the expedition. He was happy in his Succeſs, as to the concern of his glory.</p>
            <p>The Iſland was ſubdued, the <hi>Megarians</hi> who endeavored to defend it, cut in pieces; but <hi>Orgina,</hi> the Charming <hi>Orgina,</hi> for whom the War was undertaken, could not be found in the ſurrendred City; her Father had conveyed her thence ſome days before he ſtood affected to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> party, of which he had given too evident proofs. He feared the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Conquerors, and not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Strengths able to ſecure him by reſiſtance, he had by the favor of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, ſtole out of <hi>Salamina,</hi> with no greater a train then his Daughter, and a young Slave he loved.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Solons</hi> Philoſophy was now put to the teſt, to ſupport him in this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it made him ſeem unſenſible of the Honors of his Victory, and his ſecret Melancholly paſſing for Moderation; ſo charmed the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they offered him the title of King; they told him, That the Glory to obey ſo great a Man, was preferrable to the Liberty they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. <hi>Solon</hi> accepted not their offer,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94436:5"/>for beſides that, he too well loved his Countrey to ſee it inſlaved, he could not live without <hi>Orgina;</hi> he ſaw not glories enough in a Crown to fix his thoughts, whilſt ſhe was not there; and knowing likewiſe, how barren the allurements of greatneſs are, he made that Oration ſo memorable to Poſterity, wherein, after having by a thouſand thanks teſtified his acknowledgments to the People of <hi>Athens</hi> for their good will, he made it evident he ſhould declare himſelf unworthy of the offer, if he ſhould accept of the effect.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I <hi>Cannot ſuffer</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>an Appeal from the decrees of Nature, ſhe is wiſer then we; ſhe brought me into the World, ſince you had ſhook off the yoke of Dominion; had ſhe thought me fit to be your King, ſhe would have produced me in a time when that title was in my Family, or have deduced that title to my Father. What ever</hi> Libertines <hi>may ſay or practiſe, there is I know not what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible intelligence that governs the World, and diſpoſes every one in the ſphere proper for him, in which, he that has ſound ſence ſhould content himſelf. I am ſatisfied with the condition in which I am born, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94436:5"/>ſhall endeavor to die in it: For when the pomp and luſtre of Supream Dignity ſolicite my Ambition, do I not muſter up all thoſe Glories in refuſing them: I am above the higheſt degree, whilſt it is ſubmitted to my choice; and I have all the Rights of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whilſt I am aſſured of your Obedience. The Submiſſions of the People conſiſt more in their Will, then Actions; whilſt you will obey me, and I need onely command, I have all the advantages of Power, and onely ſpare my ſelf the diſguſts, and troubles of it.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This Magnanimity of <hi>Solon</hi> gained him an Authority among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> not at all inferior to the title he had refuſed, they obeyed his Orders like the voice of an Oracle. <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> beheld his glory with envy, and as obſtructive to his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſigns; but it being a principal Policy of his to win the <hi>Athenians</hi> by applauſe, he was one of the firſt to give <hi>Solon</hi> joy for the greatneſs of his actions; he exhibited ſhows to the People as a token of his congratulation, and made a magnificent Feaſt, where he expoſed to view all his riches; a vanity uſual among the Ancients, and which made up an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part of the Treat. There was to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94436:6"/>be ſeen at this of <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> Veſſels of Gold of an exceſſive weight, very rich moveables, and Stones of great price; among which, <hi>Solon</hi> obſerved a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of ſingular Beauty, which he knew to be the ſame he had given to <hi>Orgina</hi> at his departure from <hi>Salamina.</hi> The ſight of it moved him to the Soul, he asked <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi> where he got that Carbuncle; <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> ſmiled, and replied, It was a Myſtery he could not explain before ſo many Witneſſes. This anſwer troubled <hi>Solon</hi> ſo much, that he could ſcarce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it, he was impatient till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were gone, that he might clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the perplexities of his mind, and pretending ſome private buſineſs to ſtay with <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> he asked him, <hi>If he were one of thoſe Witneſſes, whom he thought unfit to hear the explanation of his myſtery. You of all the World,</hi> replied <hi>Piſiſtratus; the myſtery, in which I am concerned, is a Myſtery of Love; Judge then, Whether it ought to be truſted to a conformed Philoſopher whoſe Soul ſtands like a Rock againſt all the ſtorms of Paſſion, and who is continually Preaching its impoſſibility. I am none of thoſe Philoſophers you ſpeak of,</hi> ſaid <hi>Solon,</hi> interrupting him, <hi>I reverence Wiſdom,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94436:6"/>and would be truly wiſe, if I could; but this Wiſdom conſiſts not in a brutiſh fierceneſs: Thoſe who deſcribe her ſo, never knew her well; ſhe was made for Man, and ſhould be a ſociable Vertue. How?</hi> replied <hi>Piſiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, If I tell you, that I am in love, and that this Carbuncle is given as a token of my Miſtreſſes kindneſs; will not my Paſſion ſeem a weakneſs to you, or can you pardon my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? It is poſſible,</hi> replied <hi>Solon,</hi> whom this diſcourſe troubled more and more, <hi>I may; there are crimes carry their excuſes with them. Love is indeed of it ſelf a great extravagance, but there may be a Miſtreſs ſo perfect, that that Love may become an effect of Reaſon. Piſiſtratus</hi> had no love for <hi>Solon,</hi> and believed him as ſevere as he ſeemed to be; but it is hard for any lover to reſiſt the occaſion of ſpeaking of what they love; and he was ſo extreamly delighted with the thoughts, that ſo famed a Wiſeman approved his Paſſion, that he could not forbear crying out, <hi>Then a thouſand thanks to love, that hath made me become the moſt reaſonable of all Men; for never was there Woman ſo perfect as</hi> Orgina, <hi>nor ever was the effect of that Reaſon made me love her; ſo powerful in any Breſt as in mine.</hi> That name of <hi>Orgina</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94436:7"/>put all the Philoſophy of <hi>Solon</hi> to a ſtand. <hi>Do you call your Miſtreſs</hi> Orgina, ſaid he, interrupting him. <hi>Yes,</hi> replied <hi>Piſiſtratus, that is the name of the perſon I adore: I have heard ſpeak of her at</hi> Salamina, ſaid <hi>Solon. She is indeed of that Iſland,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Piſiſtratus, and Daughter to</hi> Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>conſiderable both for her Birth and Degree; her Father having been always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineable to the part of the</hi> Megarians, <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped out of</hi> Salamina, <hi>during the Siege, with intent to retire to</hi> Megara; <hi>but was met by an Officer of the</hi> Athenian <hi>Army, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, followed by his Daughter and a very fair young Slave, thought he might make conſiderable booty by ſeizing them, he kept his prey very cloſe fearing ſome ſharers; and returning to</hi> Athens, <hi>after the Army was diſmiſſed, he ſold me the priſoner, and his two fair attendants.</hi> Had not <hi>Solon</hi> been accomptable to Poſterity for the title of <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> that Age had given him, he had ill-recompenced <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence wherewith he obliged him: But the quality of <hi>Philoſopher</hi> is a heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for thoſe who undertake to bear it. He was forced to keep a guard upon his Sences, as upon his declared Enemies, and not daring to lift up his eyes on <hi>Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94436:7"/>fearful leaſt his countenance ſhould betray him, he asked him in a doubtful and trembling key, <hi>If he were as much beloved, as he loved.

            <p>This Relation ſo much increaſed <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>'s trouble, that grown doubtful of his power to maſter it, he thought it beſt to leave <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> and ſeeming to ſatisfie himſelf by faintly telling him, That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamina</hi> was become one of the Members of <hi>Athens,</hi> and that he ought not to treat as a Slave, a Virgin whom his Countrey had adopted, he bid him adieu, but in ſuch a diſorder, as was very ſlenderly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the reputation he had gained. Being come to his houſe, he found there <hi>Thales,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> one of the moſt famous Wiſemen of <hi>Greece,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend to our <hi>Athenian.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94436:8"/>of the Iſland of <hi>Coos</hi> had ſent him a Tripod of Gold, fiſhed out of the Sea, near their Iſland, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been caſt in there by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> in her return from <hi>Troy,</hi> and which by the Oracle of <hi>Pythia</hi> the Propheteſs, was deſtined to the wiſeſt Man of all <hi>Greece.</hi> The modeſt <hi>Thales</hi> not believing himſelf worthy that renown, reſigned it to <hi>Solon;</hi> and now came to prepare him to receive the preſent, intended to be made him next morning. <hi>Alas,</hi> cryed <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> when he underſtood the occaſion of his Friends journey, <hi>What a labyrinth is the Heart of Man. None, dear</hi> Thales, <hi>can find out its Mazes and Windings, thoſe who think a Philoſopher as perfect in the practiſe of Knowledge, as in his Precepts, would ſoon quit that Error, if the Eyes were as certainly the Windows of the Soul, as they are but the Mask. This Morality looks pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily from you,</hi> replied <hi>Thales, in the glorious occaſion that now courts you. I applaud my ſelf for the opinion I have conceived of your Wiſdom; and I obſerve with much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it is not friendſhip hath prepoſſeſſed me in your favor. Accept the Tripod, dear</hi> Solon, <hi>for you onely are worthy to receive it, nor can any other poſſeſs it without uſurpation.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94436:8"/>Thales</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> had contracted ſo ſtrict a friendſhip, there could be no Vail or Hypocriſie between them. <hi>Solon</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the <hi>Mileſian,</hi> the birth of a Daughter which he had in his youth, whoſe horoſcope had told him, She ſhould be one day fatal to her Countreys Liberty. It was by <hi>Thales</hi> Counſel ſhe was ſecretly brought up in one of the Iſles of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea, without knowing either her birth, or the misfortune threatned her. This truſt injoyned a farther, which <hi>Solon</hi> could not refuſe, he diſcovered to his friend the true ſtate of his heart, and not hiding any circumſtances of his love, <hi>Judge,</hi> added he, <hi>if I deſerve the myſterious Tripod, which the gods deſtined for the wiſeſt of Men, two or three violent Paſſions at once triumph over my Soul; I love</hi> Orgina <hi>as much as I can love, and I hate</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>as much as I can hate. I am jealous and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and in the extravagancies of my fury, know not whether I ſhould not be tranſported to act the ſame violencies againſt what I love, as what I hate. Keep the Tripod, dear</hi> Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, <hi>or make a preſent of it to ſome one that is wiſer then</hi> Solon. <hi>I know no one,</hi> replied <hi>Thales, that more appears ſo; your Laws ſeem to have been dictated by the gods, your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94436:9"/>is learned and inſtructive, you are externally calm and quiet, and have refuſed ſoveraign power, if you be not wiſe, who then is? Or, on what foundation ſhall we make judgments of Men; If it be true, that your Soul is the Whirligig of ſo many Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us deplore, dear</hi> Solon, <hi>the exceſs of humane frailty, which hath ſpred it ſelf into all Men equally, appearance onely making ſome difference between them. We can never teach true Wiſdom, we learn onely the Art of feigning</hi> Anacharſis Byas, <hi>you, and I, we are all ſubject to the ſame failings, and the gods can onely boaſt perfection.</hi> Concluding therefore, that the Tripod ought to be conſecrated to ſome divinity, they ſent it to that Temple at <hi>Thebes,</hi> which the <hi>Thebans</hi> had lately built in honor of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſirnamed the <hi>Iſmenian. Solon</hi> prevailed with <hi>Thales</hi> to ſtay ſome days longer in <hi>Athens,</hi> to aſſiſt him in his extremities with his wiſe Counſels. Whiles they were one day ſhut up together, and <hi>Thales</hi> diſwading his friends love by all the arguments his Philoſophy could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with, a Letter was brought to <hi>Solon,</hi> left by an unknown perſon at his Gate, who refuſed to ſtay for an anſwer. <hi>Solon</hi> opened it with a concern that

            <p>
               <hi>Solon</hi> burſt out into a cry of joy, at the reading of this Letter, and kiſſing with an extaſie the ſo beloved name of <hi>Orgina,</hi> put <hi>Thales</hi> into a ſtrange aſtoniſhment. <hi>Is it poſsible,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Solon, that that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo famous in all</hi> Greece, <hi>and with which I believed, you ſo liberally ſupplied, ſhould ſink under ſo weak an aſſault. Pray, my dear</hi> Thales, <hi>ſaid</hi> Solon, <hi>embracing his friend, trouble not my joy by ſuch an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable reflexion. It is no more the</hi> Solon <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated through all</hi> Greece <hi>that now ſpeaks to you; it is a ſincere friend who ſhows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unmasked to his friend. You would find
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94436:10"/>all men different from what they appear, if you could ſee their hearts naked as I diſcover mine to you: And beſides, my dear Friend, What do you call true Wiſdom, if it be not the Art to make our ſelves happy? Can our felicity reſide in any other thing? And is it not the impreſsions we ſeek of joy or grief, which create our pleaſures, or our pains? Believe me</hi> Thales, <hi>let Men think of us what they pleaſe, it is not their Opinion creates our happineſs, it is the natural motions of our own Souls. In vain would all</hi> Greece <hi>believe you happy, if you believe it not your ſelf, and others judgments of that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you found not, would but increaſe your miſery and ſorrow.</hi> Ending theſe words, he haſted to <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> Houſe reſolved to ſee <hi>Orgina,</hi> if he could poſſibly, but ſhe was not there to be found. <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> had ſurpriſed the Letter Carrier, as he came to return an account of his Commiſſion; and though the ſeeming auſterity of <hi>Solon</hi> might create a dead repoſe in his Rival, <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> who was born ſuſpitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving he could not be too watchful of a treaſure he feared to loſe, had carried away the young <hi>Orgina</hi> and her Slave, to a Countrey-houſe of his, two days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Athens.</hi> This news afflicted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94436:10"/>
               <hi>Solon</hi> as much as can be imagined, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved two or three circumſtances equally vexatious, he would not for his life that his weakneſs ſhould grow publick. The ſudden departure of <hi>Piſistratus,</hi> and that juſt at the inſtant he received <hi>Orgina</hi>'s Letter, made him conjecture ſomething of the truth; and if he were apprehenſive of his glory, he was no leſs of his love; he ſaw his Miſtreſs carried away, and in the power of a lover, whom he believed jealous, ſuch a Man as <hi>Solon</hi> ſeldom fears without ſeeking a remedy; and People who are in power ever mix the greateſt Intereſts with their own. He had begun the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> a Counſel of great authority in <hi>Athens,</hi> and whoſe Decrees have made it ſince famous; he labored in the accompliſhment of this Work, and declaring to the Aſſembly, that he had notice, that ſome <hi>Athenians</hi> held ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Salamina</hi> in a kind of ſlavery; he repreſented it as a thing ignoble, for <hi>Athens</hi> to permit, that people by her adopted ſhould be reduced to ſervitude. This Remonſtrance was thought juſt, a Decree was iſſued out againſt thoſe which held any of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Salamina,</hi> commanding their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94436:11"/>releaſe in three days, on pain of death. <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> being the onely Man aimed at in this Decree, <hi>Solon</hi> took care to give him the firſt notice.</p>
            <p>In vain had they impoſed the Penalty of Death on the Diſobeyers, <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> would have ſuffered a thouſand deaths, ere run the hazard of loſing <hi>Orgina,</hi> he ſecures himſelf with her in the Kingdom of <hi>Argos;</hi> and thoſe who had Commiſſion from the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> to make him give obedience to the Decree, found onely in his Houſe, the Slave of <hi>Amphicles. Solon</hi> grew even deſperate at this new misfortune. <hi>See now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to</hi> Thales, <hi>how much all your boaſted Wiſdom contributes to our Happineſs, had it not been for that Reputation of wiſe Man, I ſo little deſerve, I would have forced my Miſtreſs out of my Rivals Arms; ſhe was mine before he knew her, her Letter aſſures me, I have loſt no right in her; and I have a power in</hi> Athens, <hi>to which, that of</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>muſt have been conſtrained to yield: And yet becauſe I paſs for a wiſe Man, and muſt pay wondrous Caution to that Title, I am robbed of</hi> Orgina, <hi>and my rival peaceably poſſeſſes her.</hi> He would needs ſee <hi>Amphicles</hi> his Slave, to draw from her ſome little ſatisfaction, ſhe was brought to him,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94436:11"/>but, O Gods! What was his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he knew her for the ſame <hi>Orgina,</hi> he believed to be in the Kingdom of <hi>Argos</hi> with <hi>Piſistratus;</hi> he wanted the charitable advice of his friend <hi>Thales</hi> to withhold him from proclaiming the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of his Soul to all the World. <hi>We are not now alone</hi> Solon, ſaid the <hi>Mileſian</hi> in his ear, <hi>recal that Wiſdom is ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you, and believe that</hi> Solon <hi>is too much obliged to the opinions the</hi> Athenians <hi>have conceived of him, thus at once by his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to convince them of Error. Solon</hi> ſtrove hard to recollect himſelf, and appear what he was thought, and receiving <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina</hi> with that gravity, his heart approved not, he got rid of the company in the moſt unconcerned manner he could; but after he thought himſelf at liberty to return to himſelf, and love, and beheld, after having believed his <hi>Orgina</hi> loſt, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone with her, What ſaid he not? or, what did he not do? to pay his love thoſe Rites Philoſophy would have rob'd it of. The love of thoſe who make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Wiſdom is much more ardent then that of ordinary Lovers; it is not diſpelled by any exterior ceremony, but as it reſerves it ſelf inward and intire for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94436:12"/>great occaſions, ſo it ordinarily breaks forth to advantage. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaid <hi>Solon</hi> to <hi>Orgina,</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>believed himſelf aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of your love; yet I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had reaſon to believe it. But</hi> Orgina <hi>I conjure you tell me he had none. I have ſo great a confidence in what you ſay, that your words ſhould make me give my very eyes the lie, therefore tell me, nothing may make me leſs happy; for why ſhould you declare your ſelf guilty, when I will believe you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, if you will but ſay you are ſo. I thank you Sir for your confidence,</hi> replied <hi>Orgina, it is of all your qualities what I ſhall make the leaſt uſe, a Miſtreſs ſhould not be believed but upon unreproachable teſtimony, and a Love ſo confiding, has a Face of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference; Believe me to be with</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>in</hi> Argos, <hi>till ſuch time as you are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he miſtakes my Fathers Slave for me, and that by the help of that diſguiſe I am preſerved wholly for</hi> Solon. How cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Solon</hi> in an extaſie, <hi>Is it your Slave then</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>hath carried to</hi> Argos, <hi>and is it you he hath always thought the Slave of</hi> Amphicles. <hi>Yes Sir,</hi> replied <hi>Orgina, my Father made uſe of this precaution, the better to preſerve me in the dangers of our flight; he believed he might more eaſily conceal me
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94436:12"/>as a ſimple Slave, then as his Daughter; the perſon be choſe to ſupply my place, is young, handſome, and vertuous.</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>eaſily believed her what ſhe appeared, and I thought it a juſt debt to the merit of that fair Maid, not to hinder her Marriage with one of the cheifeſt Men of</hi> Athens; <hi>the adventure of the Carbuncle was innocently contrived to give you notice of the place where I was. But Sir, methinks you believe me very eaſily, the quiet and tranquility of your mind has gained head, ſince I have been out of your ſight, you are neither jealous nor ſuſpitious. Can one be a Lover indeed, without theſe qualities. Solon</hi> relieved <hi>Orgina</hi> from the fears of theſe nice apprehenſions, by making to her proteſtations, never learn'd in the Schools of Wiſdom, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to haſten the hour of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by advancing the publication of thoſe Laws, might permit him to marry a <hi>Salaminian,</hi> he finiſhed that great and painful work: But to let <hi>Orgina</hi> ſee, that he dedicated not himſelf ſo abſolutely to the ſervice of the State, but he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Heart to his Love; the ſame day that he engraved his ſerious Laws and Policies on thoſe Tables, whereon they were to be preſented to the People,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94436:13"/>he made particular ones for his Miſtreſs of which, ſee here ſome Articles.</p>

               <hi>As he finiſhed this Gallantry,</hi> Thales <hi>entred his Chamber,</hi> I return to <hi>Miletum, Solon, ſaid he,</hi> I have ſojourned but too long at <hi>Athens,</hi> you ſhall, I hope, never ſee me more; and therefore before I depart, I thought fit to tell you that your Daughter is loſt, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates who were courſing for Booty about the <hi>Aegaean</hi> Iſles, hoping her beauty might make her prize conſiderable, took her away, without ever ſince being heard of. I came hither to tell you this misfortune, rather then to ſpeak to you of the Tripod; but I found you ſo weak, that I thought to attempt the reducing you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94436:14"/>to the Eſtate of Wiſdom, before I put you to this tryal. I now find you are perverted for ever, and therefore I do, what I hoped in vain to do more to the purpoſe another time. Solon <hi>was ſo ſurpriſed at this news, and the manner in which his friend told it him, that he had not the power to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt him; but having had time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf whilſt he diſcourſed;</hi> Is it <hi>Thales, ſaid he,</hi> that tells <hi>Solon</hi> one of the greateſt misfortunes could poſſibly happen to him, without appearing himſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have been too much concerned for you, <hi>replied</hi> Thales, nor ſhould I, had I not been ſenſible of your misfortunes, have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed converſe with a Man in love. I ſhould have deſerted you, when I found you deſerted that Wiſdom firſt united us: That friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip I had for you, made me renounce my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity for your relief; I have ſtaid with you, have endured to hear you talk of your Paſſion; and wretch, that I am, there wants but little that your diſeaſe is become contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I looked the other day upon your <hi>Orgina,</hi> with an intention, I never had for any thing but my Books: I cannot baniſh from my memory the bewitching <hi>Idea</hi> that object left there, I find a kind of indulgence for your weakneſs; it delights me as much as it terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94436:15"/>me before; and even the confuſed vapors of Sleep, conſpire to the breach of my quiet. <hi>Athens,</hi> pernicious <hi>Athens,</hi> thou ſhalt never ſee <hi>Thales</hi> more, the diſtemper he hath begun to contract in thee, cannot be cured, but by his flight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſo finiſhing thoſe words,</hi> Thales <hi>went out of the Cloſet, and without more delay hired a paſſage for</hi> Miletum, <hi>not ſuffering the Prayers or Diſtreſs of</hi> Solon, <hi>to ſtay him a minute longer. After this ſo unexpected parting,</hi> Solon <hi>went to ſee</hi> Orgina, <hi>to acquaint her with what had hapned to him.</hi> The Gods had too much favored me, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> inreſtoring my <hi>Orgina</hi> to me. If they had likewiſe preſerved to me my Danghter, and my Friend, I ſhould have forgot my ſelf in ſuch height of Happineſs; and ſome great misfortune was neceſſary to ballance the joy I had in your recovery. But, then let my dear <hi>Orgina,</hi> be all things to me, ſince in finding her, I loſe all things. Orgina <hi>received that obliging requeſt, as ſhe ought to do it, ſhe made new Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Love and Fidelity to</hi> Solon, <hi>ſhe endeavored to apply comfort to thoſe misfortunes he already ſuffered under; and to gain from him the knowledge of thoſe he feared for the future, ſhe heard
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94436:15"/>him relate all the particulars of the Birth and Horoſcope of his Daughter; but when in one part of the ſtory ſhe heard him call his Daughter</hi> Hypparete. <hi>Hyppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete,</hi> Sir, <hi>ſaid ſhe with a nimble haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Yes, <hi>replied</hi> Solon, ſo was my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called; and Sir (<hi>continued</hi> Orgina) of what age, of what ſtature, and what form of countenance, as near as you can gueſs was this <hi>Hypparete.</hi> She is of middle ſtature, <hi>replied</hi> Solon, ſlender, fair complexioned, bright haired, her noſe aquiline, black-eyed, and particularly remarkable for a Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie, Nature took pleaſure to imprint on one of her hands, whence I took the Etymology of that name of <hi>Hypparete,</hi> which I gave her. Ah Sir, <hi>replied</hi> Orgina, ſeek not for <hi>Hypparete</hi> among Pyrates, ſhe is in the hands of one of your own Citizens: It is that ſame Slave my Father bought ſome time before our departure from <hi>Salamina,</hi> who paſſed for me during, the time of our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and whom, <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> at preſent, keeps in the Kingdom of <hi>Argos. This news was very unwelcome to</hi> Solon, <hi>he loved his Countrey, as may be judged by his own refuſing the Dominion over it, he knew the ambitious humor of</hi> Piſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus, <hi>and his flight from</hi> Athens <hi>having angred the</hi> Areopagites, <hi>they had iſſued a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94436:16"/>Decree againſt his Body and Goods. This rigor furniſhed him with a pretence to Enterpriſes, and the Fortune of</hi> Hyppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rete <hi>aſſured their ſucceſs. Our Law-giver was ſo afflicted with the misfortunes his foreſight denounced, that he could not reſolve to ſtay and be a witneſs to them; he baniſhed himſelf willingly from</hi> Athens, <hi>and took that long voyage through all the Realms of</hi> Greece, <hi>which his advice to</hi> Craeſus <hi>made ſo memorable. Thoſe private Authors from whence I extracted this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, have not told me whether</hi> Orgina <hi>followed</hi> Solon. <hi>I will believe for the glory of the wiſe Man, that his Folly reached not ſo far; it is enough that he loved, and that his love was the innocent cauſe of the enthralment of his Countrey. I would likewiſe be perſwaded that he married the Daughter of</hi> Amphicles, <hi>but when we come to think his Miſtreſs his Wife, we cannot well think ſhe ſtaid behind at</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. Solons <hi>Predictions had a full effect,</hi> Piſiſtratus <hi>ſubjected his Countrey, and reigned peaceably the reſt of his days. Let us now ſearch, if this ſame City, ſo famous among the Ancients, and ſo fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in great Men, cannot furniſh us with other Examples to employ ſome pleaſant hours.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is not of abſolute neceſſity for that Man to be handſome, who defignes to make <hi>Love.</hi> The beſt Deſcriptions the World has given us of <hi>Socrates</hi> containe little anſwerable to the qualities of a <hi>Lover.</hi> He was neither of a Courtly Humour, nor of taking Shape or Feature. He made Profeſſion of an <hi>Auſtere Philoſophy,</hi> and yet for all this he was in <hi>Love:</hi> But, as <hi>Love</hi> knows how to change his ſhape,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94436:17"/>and put on what diſguiſe he pleaſes; it was not under his ordinary figure he crept into the Soul of <hi>Socrates,</hi> but under the Image of <hi>Virtue. Timandra</hi> a young <hi>Phrygian</hi> Lady, famous to Poſterity for the adventures we are about to relate, was Daughter to one of <hi>Socrates</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends. Some private reaſons having obliged this Gentleman to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Athens,</hi> he dies, and valuing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orates</hi> his Friendſhip equal to himſelf, truſts to his care his only Daughter, a charge which the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> accepts with joy and generoſity. This Lady was very fair, and <hi>Socrates</hi> diſcerned in her ſuch ſparkes of wit and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he hoped might be one day im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into hands of Wiſdom: He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to make her a <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and, prudently judging that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the World might obſtruct his deſign, he committed <hi>Timandra</hi> to the cares of <hi>Aglaonice</hi> the <hi>Aſtrologeſs,</hi> who, under the pretence of making her <hi>Celeſtial Obſervations,</hi> lived in an extreame Solitude. <hi>Socrates</hi> charmed with the good diſpoſitions he found in the Soul of <hi>Timandra,</hi> would ſpend whole dayes in forming her Manners after the Rules
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94436:17"/>of Vertue: <hi>For what reaſon</hi> (would he ſay to her) <hi>think you, the gods have made you be borne ſo accompliſhed? 'Tis neither out of any ſingular love to your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor out of any hate to other Women, made leſs perfect; but, 'tis to manifeſt in you the power of the qualities of the Soul above thoſe of the Body: had you had but an ordinary Beauty, the aſſaults made on your Virtue would have been ſo feeble, your Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would not become an Example: but now, when in the faireſt Lady of all</hi> Greece <hi>there ſhall be obſerved a Soul impregnable againſt all the aſſaults of Paſſion, a laudable diſdain of periſhable and tranſitory pleaſures, and ſolid love, for thoſe can never waſt; you will become a Living Axiome, which all the Arguments of our</hi> Libertines <hi>ſhall not have the boldneſs to inſult over.</hi> Theſe Arguments, which one would have thought ſhould only have alarm'd the Gallant, gave yet the Alarme to Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Love, and beat up a Charge to his Spouſe <hi>Myrto, Socrates</hi> Wife, who, for all her being Daughter to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named the Juſt, was not her ſelf the more ſo, obſerved ſome trouble in her Husband, when he ſaw not <hi>Timandra,</hi> and diſcovering, he paid his Viſits to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94436:18"/>that Lady when ever he could get from her, conceived a furious Jealouſie. This Woman ſeemed to have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out by Heaven to keep the Virtue of <hi>Socrates</hi> in breath. Never was there VVife more untractable; and, becauſe ſhe had kept her honour untainted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhelter of little temptations, ſhe became a mercileſs Tyrant, exacting tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Patience from thoſe leaſt ought to pay it; She aſperſed <hi>Timandra</hi> with all the Titles her Jealouſie could dictate: <hi>But</hi> Myrto, (ſaid Socrates to her) <hi>Is it from your own experience you judge ſo ill of the vertue of your Sex? We ſhould ſeldome ſuſpect failings in others, of which our ſelves are not, or have not a will to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Do you think the Gods have favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with a peculiar priviledge? or whilſt you would have them believed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of Chaſtity to you, is it to be preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they are niggards to all other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? I know not what to anſwer to theſe</hi> Sophiſtryes (ſaid <hi>Myrto</hi> interrupting him) <hi>I read no Book but my Prayers, and would ſcarce be well pleaſed with any other; but theſe frequent meetings and interviews between different Sexes are neither lawful nor honeſt, there is alwayes in them ſome

Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an angry Woman</hi> (replyed <hi>Socrates</hi> coldly) <hi>theſe are viſions of her Jealous Fancy, which have neither likelihood nor foundation. How</hi> (ſaid <hi>Alcibiades</hi>) <hi>is it not true then you have that affection for this</hi> Timandra, <hi>at which your Wife appeares ſo alarm'd at. I acknowledge</hi> (replyed <hi>Socrates</hi>) <hi>I have delighted to Cultivate and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94436:19"/>improve an excellent good Nature, which Chance offered to my Cares, and which all the conſiderations of Friendſhip oblige me not to ſee lie fallow; And, this excellent good Nature,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him) <hi>is ſeated in a fair and youthful perſon; What is that Circumſtance to our purpoſe</hi> (replyed the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> in a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what an angry tone) <hi>or, What communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation can there be between the Beauty of a Woman, and the Soul of</hi> Socrates? <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> was now returned from his firſt Exile, and had had ſome experience in Love; <hi>I talked like you</hi> (replyed he) <hi>when I was admoniſhed againſt the charmes of</hi> Nemea; <hi>How! would I ſay to my ſelf, can</hi> Alcibiades, <hi>whom the chiefeſt Ladies of</hi> Athens <hi>are proud to favour, and whom a great Queen did not diſdaine, love a Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan: I will ſee her, and if my heart can find leaſure to caſt off nobler Paſſions, Court her perhaps for ſome few houres; but, this light distraction cannot be called Love, nor is</hi> Nemea <hi>of a quality conſiderable enough to give it me; this was once my Song, and yet</hi> Socrates <hi>you know whither this Love hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, to what Cenſure I expoſed my ſelf by it; and, into what dangers it led my am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Your ſoul and mine are very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94436:20"/>ſaid</hi> Socrates, <hi>your Riches continually ſollicite your delights; you are ſoftned by pleaſures irreparably attending your degree, and finding your ſelf alwayes in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to attempt reliefe, you may deſire all things; for my part, the meanneſs of my fortunes ſecure my reſt and quiet; I regard Beauty but as an effect of Nature, which teaches me the knowledge of its cauſe; and finding matter to exerciſe my Virtue in that which debauches yours, from that wreck I learn to keep my ſelf in the Port. Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> ſaid many other things to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi> to oblige him not to have ſuch ſtedfaſt confidence in his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but he could not ſhake the opinion <hi>Socrates</hi> had of its fortitude. Though he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Timandra</hi> to be worthy of love, yet he would not grant <hi>Socrates</hi> to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Loving. But, the teſtimony he had given of the merit of the faire <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi> ſtir'd up a curioſity in <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> to ſee if <hi>Socrates</hi> were as well skill'd in his diſtinctions of <hi>Beauty</hi> as <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> he had obſerved by their diſcourſe the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi> was covetous of his Treaſure, he believed if he would have a ſight of it, it muſt be by ſtealth, he therefore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Socrates</hi> to be watcht, to find out <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandra</hi>'s
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94436:20"/>Houſe; and, having diſcover'd it, he Apparelled himſelf like a <hi>Phrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and making choice of a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he knew the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> imploy'd in giving publick Leſſons to his Schollers, he preſents himſelf at <hi>Timandra</hi>'s Gate, pretending himſelf a <hi>Phrigian,</hi> come to bring her Newes from her Countrey; he ſpoke very well all Languages in uſe in his time; and, among other admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities which graced him, he had a moſt excellent way of acting all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes: But, <hi>Socrates</hi> had given ſuch Orders at <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s, as were proofe againſt all occaſions and all artifices. The <hi>Aſtrologeſs</hi> came in the place of the <hi>Phrigian,</hi> and her perſon being illfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and diſpleaſing, as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hoped to find it beautiful and charming, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated two or three paces at ſight of her, and much ſurprized, asked her, <hi>If ſhe were</hi> Socrates <hi>his Scholler?

Aglaonice</hi> well pleaſed with the opportunity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill with her the lovely <hi>Phrigian,</hi> ſearches her Books, and after a long confronting of the <hi>Signes</hi> and <hi>Planets, Are you diſcreet,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to the diſguis'd</hi> Athenian? <hi>Yes, without doubt,</hi> replyed he; <hi>and, for your better aſsurance, one of the beſt Friends</hi> Alcibiades <hi>ever had: He is then,</hi> ſaid ſhe, inclining her head to whiſper it in his eare, <hi>at preſent making Courtſhip to one of the faireſt Ladies of</hi> Athens, <hi>whom he loves, and by whom he is as ardently beloved: Alcibiades</hi> could not forbear burſting out into Laughter at the reſult of this Obſervation, and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologeſs</hi> being half put out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; <hi>I believe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you doubt of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94436:22"/>what I have told you: Pardon me, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Alcibiades, you could not hit any thing righter, I have ſuch viſible proofes of the certainty of your Science, that I will go admoniſh</hi> Alcibiades <hi>to be more cautious for the future; for, ſince all he does is ſo perfectly known, he ought to do nothing which he feares ſhould grow pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi> With this Irony <hi>Alcibiades</hi> took his leave, leaving the <hi>Aſtrologeſs</hi> more taken with the Charmes of the <hi>Phrygian,</hi> then he was ill ſatisfied with the uglineſs of the falſe <hi>Timandra;</hi> he had gone but few ſteps from thence when he was met by <hi>Socrates:</hi> That <hi>Philoſopher</hi> made his publick Leſſons very ſhort, having more pleaſing private ones to give elſewhere; he caſt a ſower look at his Friend when he ſaw him diſguis'd in that manner, and not doubting but Love had a part in the Metamorphoſis, he was preparing to make him one of thoſe Remonſtrances wherewith he uſed to Declaime againſt Voluptuouſneſs: But <hi>Alcibiades</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting him; <hi>I gueſs all you would ſay, dear</hi> Socrates, ſaid he, <hi>I confeſs I am in an error, and that you have reaſon to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me, but I am puniſh'd enough by my own curioſity, and by the diſpleaſure it gave
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94436:23"/>me, I ſhall never hereafter be ſo vain, and if I could have ſuſpected you of ſo groſs a diſcernement, your</hi> Timandra <hi>had not coſt me the trouble of a diſguiſe.</hi> At that word he parted, not being in humour to hear <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Morallo.</hi> And, the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> more troubled at what he had heard, then at all the accidents of his life, haſtned the ſmall remainder of his way to <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s, whom asking for at entrance, and underſtanding ſhe was in the Garden, he poſts to her to upbraid her negligence. <hi>You have promiſed me</hi> (ſaid he chaſing) <hi>that you would not let</hi> Timandra <hi>be ſeen by any other Man i'th' world; It was agreed you ſhould receive the Compliments, addreſſed to her, that we might better order all our Meaſures for the defeating the Snares and Stratagems of the Curious, and yet</hi> Aglaonice, <hi>you whom I believed a woman of extraordinary truſt, and to whoſe charge I have committed the perſon in whom I had placed all my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, betray this confidence, and your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in favour of</hi> Alcibiades. <hi>I,</hi> cryed out the <hi>Aſtrologeſs, I let</hi> Alcibiades <hi>ſee</hi> Timandra; <hi>From whom have you this falſe Story? 'Tis too much a truth,</hi> replyed Socrates, <hi>I have it from</hi> Alcibiades <hi>own
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94436:23"/>mouth, whom I met not ten ſteps off, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed like a</hi> Phrigian, <hi>and, who told me, he came from</hi> Timandra. <hi>If it were</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades, continued <hi>Aglaonice, came to aske for</hi> Timandra <hi>in the</hi> Phrigian <hi>habit, forbear to trouble your ſelf, 'twas I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Viſit, and 'tis me he takes for your young</hi> Phrigian: Whereupon ſhe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him all the paſſages of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view between her and the ſuppoſed <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi> making him almoſt break his Spleen with Laughing at the fallacies of her Science, and the ſurprize wherein ſhe repreſented <hi>Alcibiades. Timandra</hi>'s Cloſet windows anſwer'd directly to the place where this Converſation was held, ſo that ſhe loſt not one word of it; and, diſcontented with the Captivity of her Condition, deſignes a revenge by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Alcibiades;</hi> To this purpoſe ſhe Bribes one of <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s Houſhold Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and entruſting him with a <hi>Letter</hi> for the Illuſtrious <hi>Athenian,</hi> makes him promiſe to deliver it to his own hand.

               <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> who, according to the Mode of ignorant <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> found ſtill in the <hi>Stars</hi> what pleaſed her ſelf, rather then what they denounced, was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> Aſcendant and her own Leer'd at one another with a kind of Sympathetical Aſpect; ſhe would have Sworn by the faith of her Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that he was neceſſitated by an over-ruling influence to love her; and, believing ſhe ought to preſs forward ſo happy a deſtiny, by ſome kind exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe had entruſted an Apprentice in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> who daily came to honour her with his meaner offerings, to give <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in the behalf of the young <hi>Phrigian</hi> Lady, the following <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>

            <p>An hour after the Meſſenger of <hi>Aglao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> was diſpatched, <hi>Timandra</hi>'s came to preſent her Letter, and demand the like expedition. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> believed it was a ſecond Epiſtle of the Nature of the firſt, he had too many pleaſant intrigues upon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94436:25"/>his hands, to ſpare time for a commerce ſo nauſeous and troubleſome. <hi>You may tell</hi> Timandra, ſaid he, <hi>refuſing to receive the Letter ſhe ſent him, that I gueſs what her Letter contains, and that my engagements with</hi> Socrates <hi>permit me not to have any with her; and therefore I deſire her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear theſe kindneſſes for ever.</hi> Theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible words being brought to <hi>Timandra,</hi> ſhe received with ſuch an anger mixed with ſhame, as made her eaſily reſolve on the Silence impoſed. But <hi>Aglaonice</hi> not ſo eaſily offended, and whoſe skill promiſed her more happy ſucceſs in her enterpriſe, would not be repulſed for one difficulty; ſhe aſſaſſinated <hi>Alcibiades</hi> with Aſtrological menaces, he could never come home without finding ſome note or other from the falſe <hi>Timandra;</hi> they were ſtrewed upon his Table, and in his Cloſet, as if they had been his daily <hi>Agenda,</hi> he reſolved to ſtop this current. He was naturally kind and civil, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to avoid all occaſions of rudeneſs towards a Sex he adored; but theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meſſages from a Woman, might prejudice him in ſome other affairs, he writ to the Aſtrologeſs in terms admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no Anſwer; and that ſhe might not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94436:25"/>feign the miſcarriage of his Letter he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted his Nurſe with the delivery. She was a very notable Woman, called <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla,</hi> and a <hi>Lacedemonian;</hi> but the Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of <hi>Sparta,</hi> could not ſecure her from ſome flyings out of Blood and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. She takes out of <hi>Alcibiades</hi>'s Cloſet Petrified Plants, ſeveral Sea Animals dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and becoming a Merchant of this ſort of traffick, ſhe goes and asks at <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandra</hi>'s Gate, if they would buy any of her Curioſities. The fair <hi>Phrygian</hi> was alone contrary to her Cuſtom, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> was retired for ſome days to a houſe out of <hi>Athens,</hi> where he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to maintain a publick diſpute, and <hi>Aglaonice</hi> weakned with the watchings, and agonies of Love, did that day keep her bed, <hi>Timandra</hi> would needs ſee <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla</hi>'s rarities, and ſhe ſet them forth with all the terms and tattle requiſite in the perſon, ſhe played, and following the <hi>Phrygian</hi> to a Window, where ſhe was looking on a petrified Fruit, ſlipping the Letter into her hand, <hi>See there Madam,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the rarest piece of all my Shop,</hi> Alcibiades <hi>ſends it you.</hi> The <hi>Phrygian</hi> bluſht at that name, and opening her hand, that ſhe might not receive what
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94436:26"/>was offered her. <hi>You may tell</hi> Alcibiades, ſaid ſhe to the counterfeit Merchant, <hi>that I gueſs what the Letter contains, and that my engagements with</hi> Socrates <hi>permit me not to have any with him.</hi> At which words ſhe ſtept into her Cloſet, leaving the poor Nurſe much afflicted at the ill ſucceſs of her negotiation, ſhe returns forthwith to <hi>Alcibiades. Your buſineſs goes ill Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I preſented your Letter with all the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you could expect from me, but</hi> Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra <hi>would not receive it; ſhe ſends you word, that ſhe gueſſes what it contains, and that her engagements with</hi> Socrates <hi>permit her not to have any with you. Alcibiades</hi> burſt out with laughing at the repetition of the ſame words, he remembred to have ſent formerly to her. <hi>How!</hi> cryed he, <hi>and am I become diſpleaſing even to</hi> Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra, <hi>Destiny is my friend, and I ow it a Sacrifice of Thanks; Lord Sir,</hi> cryed <hi>Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla,</hi> much ſurpriſed, <hi>I thought I brought your deaths wound, when I told you that a perſon of ſuch Heavenly Beauty would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your addreſſes. Amycla</hi> had art, and would droll very pleaſantly, and <hi>Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades</hi> often delighted to hear her, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ſhe had a mind now to divert him as ſhe uſed. <hi>Indeed,</hi> ſays he ironically,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94436:26"/>Timandra <hi>is a very Heavenly Beauty, that ſtaring ghaſtly air which in her Face, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the diſorders of her Mind; that ill ſhaped Carcaſs; that conſtrained Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that leaneſs brought upon her by her Chimerical Studies, are all moving Reaſons of Diſpair in a Man not beloved. What ſay you of leanneſs, ill ſhape, or ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Countenance,</hi> ſaid <hi>Amycla</hi> interrupting him, <hi>I could find no ſuch thing in the young</hi> Timandra, <hi>ſhe is as beautiful in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as well ſhaped in Body; her Ways and Manners are obliging; nor know I a Beauty in</hi> Athens <hi>can be juſtly compared to her. Alcibiades</hi> could not reconcile this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with what his eyes had ſeen; and therefore conjures his Nurſe to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and unravel the Intrigue. <hi>Amycla</hi> returns to <hi>Timandra,</hi> and feigning to have loſt ſomething, deſires to ſpeak with her, to know if ſhe had found it. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandra</hi> miſtruſting ſome new Meſſage from <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> which her anger for the old repulſe, would not now let her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, goes into <hi>Aglaonices</hi>'s Chamber, to give Audience to <hi>Amycla. Alcibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi>'s Nurſe found in the Aſtrologeſs, what he believ'd to have found in the <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian,</hi> and running preſently to tell him the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94436:27"/>truth, threw him into a Melancholly not eaſily repreſented; his Natural admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for fair Ladies amounted even to Idolatry, and he could not without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, conſider he had given ſuch a one occaſion to be angry with him, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the aſſiſtance of <hi>Amycla:</hi> She ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices him to return ſome ſhews of love to <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> thereby to get opportunity of ſeeing <hi>Timandra,</hi> and undertaking to manage the affair, goes forthwith from him to <hi>Aglaonice;</hi> and tells her the indifference practiſed and affected by <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> was but a cunning to make tryal of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe profeſſed, which her perſeverance having confirmed, he was ready to be at her ſervice; that he knew well the Stars preſided in affairs of Love, and that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting without murmur to their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe might diſpoſe of his deſtiny, as its abſolute Miſtreſs. <hi>Aglaonice</hi> was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy at this complement of <hi>Amyclaes;</hi> ſhe requirted the happy news with the gift of a rich Ring from her Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and the abſence of <hi>Socrates</hi> giving him fair opportunity to make his viſits; <hi>Alcibiades</hi> grew ſo familiar in that houſe, that no hours were interdicted him, he cunningly drew from the Aſtrologeſs an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94436:27"/>aſſurance, that ſhe writ not that Letter he had refuſed to read, and both from thence, and from what <hi>Timandra</hi> had ſaid to <hi>Amycla,</hi> concluded, That it was the <hi>Phrygian</hi> had writ it, he was raging mad to ſee her, and to know her commands. But it was almoſt impoſſible to compaſs his deſire, <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s diligence, and the indignation wherewith the <hi>Phrygian</hi> was prepoſſeſſed, made fruitleſs all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            <p>This ill ſucceſs made him almoſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, <hi>Amycla</hi> gave him deſcriptions of <hi>Timandra,</hi> which inflamed his curioſity, and the moſt moderate deſires become violent when they meet with oppoſition. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> had thoughts to baniſh all he ought to <hi>Socrates</hi> friendſhip, by forcing a ſight of the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Lady, ſince he could not fairly find a way to obtain it; but the fear to diſoblige her, whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loved before he knew her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him, he bethought himſelf at length of an Artifice had leſs noiſe in it, and which ſucceeded happily. <hi>Socrates</hi> was almoſt upon return to <hi>Athens, Alcibiades</hi> pretended to have promiſed the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> not to go to <hi>Aglaonice</hi>'s, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly betrayed as much fear to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94436:28"/>by the coming of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy to be deprived of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aglaonice,</hi> to accommodate all it was agreed to meet privately in a Grove, about a mile diſtant from <hi>Athens,</hi> which was called the <hi>Academy.</hi> In this place Philoſophical Conferences were held, and it took its Etymology from <hi>Academes,</hi> a Greek <hi>Hero</hi> born in that place; but ſince the name has been given to all places where Vertue is publickly exerciſed. The Conditions being concluded with <hi>Aglao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> the time to put them in execution came, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> made ſhow that <hi>Socrates</hi> was returned, and by Letter conjured the Aſtrologeſs to keep her word. She needed not much ſummoning, ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends herſelf to Love and the Stars, and placing this amorous aſſignation among the favorable Conſtellations hyes her to the Academy at the hour appointed. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> who had placed his Sentinels at <hi>Timandra</hi>'s door, to know when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of his <hi>Argus,</hi> was no ſooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed that <hi>Aglaonice</hi> was gone, but he haſtens to make advantage of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: The Servants would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Socrates</hi> Order, and hindered <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> from going up to <hi>Timandra</hi>'s
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94436:28"/>Lodgings; but Love had made him a <hi>Hector,</hi> he threatned with death the firſt that oppoſed his paſſage and coming to the <hi>Phrygians</hi> Chamber, ſurpriſed her as much with his ſight, as himſelf was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored with hers. <hi>How, Madam,</hi> (ſaid he, retreating two or three paces) <hi>is it from you I have refuſed to receive a Letter? Is it to you I have committed the firſt rudeneſs that ever I was guilty of towards your ſex, and was it againſt you I conceived ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual an Averſion? Ah Madam,</hi> added he, in a paſſionate accent, <hi>What can my heart do, to attone the offence of its blindneſs? Can all the Love and Service it has prepared for you, ever be capable to blot out its crime? I found by your diſcourſe, that you are</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades (replied <hi>Timandra,</hi> in a kind of troubled accent) <hi>the eſteem I always had for your reputation, was never ſo mortified by my anger, but 'tis revived by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But Sir, from whence come you? Cannot all the fair Ladies in</hi> Athens <hi>ſatisfie your curioſity, without ſearching out her whom</hi> Socrates <hi>forbids you the ſight of: Speak not of</hi> Socrates, <hi>I beſeech you Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alcibiades</hi> interrupting her; <hi>If he love you, he is no longer dear enough to me to merit ſo much reſervedneſs, as that I ſhould
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94436:29"/>forbear it; and if he loves you not, he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to deprive me of you ſight. He loves me not,</hi> replied <hi>Timandra, or at leaſt, if he loves me, 'tis more then either of us know. But Sir, he is paſſionately in love with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he has endeavored to communicate to me that Illuſtrious Paſſion; but he fears a merit like yours will be able to destroy all his Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Retire therefore Sir, and leave all my Soul to the Wiſdom, to which</hi> Socrates <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted it. I feel already, I know not what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in ſpeaking to you, which grows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with that conſtancy and firmneſs, he has ſo long Preached. You affect me with ſome thing, I can neither ſuppreſs nor define. Pray then Sir withdraw your ſight and</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates <hi>Rules, can never agree together.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades <hi>was tranſported with Love and Joy at this innocent Confeſſion. Forget</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Timandra</hi>) <hi>Precepts condemned by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which Heaven teſtified to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved, when it produced you ſo fair: It becomes</hi> Socrates <hi>who has onely the Beauty of the Soul in his dividend to renounce the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Sences. He ſpares himſelf great vexations, when he prevents the troubleſome conſequences might accrew from his want of Charm. But you fair</hi> Timandra, <hi>who are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94436:29"/>made to be adored by all that approach you, reverſe the orders of Heaven, when you bury your Talents in a retreat, makes them uſeleſs. That which</hi> Socrates <hi>has told me,</hi> ſaid the fair <hi>Phrygian,</hi> interrupting him, <hi>was much more judicious then what you tell me; and yet Sir, by what fate I know not, I begin to find all his knowledge too feeble to perſwade me, whilst your words peirce even into my very heart, they have already ſetled a ſecret intelligence with the Motions of my Soul, and make my Sence revolt againſt my Reaſon: Yet once more Sir retire, your ſight becomes pernicious to me, and if you have not ſome pitty on my Philoſophy, three or four years ſtudy will fall under the firſt aſſaults of your preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt things paſſed thus at <hi>Timan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>'s other accidents, no leſs ſingular hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at the Academy. <hi>Aglaonice</hi> was come as ſhe had promiſed, but in going ſhe had loſt the note that contained the Order of the Aſſignation, which was found by one of <hi>Socrates</hi> ſervants, who carried it to his Maſter. <hi>Socrates</hi> ſoon knew <hi>Alcibiades</hi> hand, and the houſe where he was, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far from the Academy, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give an interruption to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He often did theſe diſpleaſures to

               <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> he loved him tenderly, and he knew that his inclinations to love, were often hurtful to his affairs.

He found <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſtill with <hi>Timandra,</hi> he was ſo charmed with the ſight of her, that neither policy in him, nor prayers from her, could make him conſent to leave it. <hi>There is Tyranny in what you have done,</hi> ſaid <hi>Socrates,</hi> in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry manner, <hi>You ſnatch from me a ſecret I would have kept, and without reſpect to that friendſhip ſhould be ſo dear to you, refuſe me the firſt compliance I ever exacted from

'Tis not that friendſhip</hi> Socrates <hi>makes you thus hot,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, <hi>your anger would have been better moderated, had it had ſo eaſie a cauſe; but</hi> Socrates <hi>you love</hi> Timandra, <hi>I ever miſtruſted it, the diſorder wherein now you appear, confirms all my ſuſpitions.</hi> It was moſt certain, as <hi>Socrates</hi> had proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the prying <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> that he did not believe he loved <hi>Timandra,</hi> he had that confidence in his wiſdom, gave him not leiſure to examine himſelf on this point; but his friends reproach forcing him to a ſudden review of himſelf, he found his precaution was ſtrong Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and examining the dreadful fears he had had, leaſt <hi>Timandra</hi> ſhould love or be beloved, he found out that nothing but love could create ſuch violent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he let himſelf fall into a Chair, more concerned with what he began to diſcover then a criminal at the reading his ſentence, and looking on <hi>Alcibiades</hi> with an anger mixed with kindneſs, which at the ſame time drew Compaſſion and Jealouſie from his friend. <hi>What have I done to you</hi> Alcibiades, ſaid he, <hi>thus to ſtir up in my Breſt, thoughts I knew not of, and which prove moſt cruel, becauſe they can
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94436:32"/>be no longer unknown? I have loved you better, then you have loved your ſelf; I have hazarded my life, my credit, and the eſteem of all</hi> Athens, <hi>to maintain your intereſts; I have oppoſed your weakneſſes and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with all my power, and when I could not maſter them, have concealed them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful</hi> Alcibiades, <hi>why ſhould you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover mine? If I love not</hi> Timandra, <hi>you injure my reputation in accuſing me, and if I love her, as I begin to fear I do, you tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs againſt friendſhip, by expoſing your ſelf to the hazard of being my Rival. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your ſelf from this danger</hi> Alcibiades, <hi>and whether you regard me as a Philoſopher, who would preſerve his Schollar exempt from Paſſion; or whether you regard me as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend, who merits ſome compliance. Withdraw your ſelf, and ſee</hi> Timandra <hi>no more.

Stand out then</hi> Socrates, <hi>and ſtand out with ſucceſs, you will ſully the glory of your life, if you leave Poſterity to believe, that the voluptuous</hi> Alcibiades <hi>had gain'd over himſelf, what you dare not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe on yours.</hi>

            <p>In thoſe times as well as now a dayes, the Marriages of Great People were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Politick then Sympathetical unions; <hi>Pompeia</hi> privately loved <hi>Publius Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> had a violent inclination for <hi>Murcia,</hi> who was afterwards the Wife of <hi>Pompey.</hi> The neceſſity <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> ſtood in of <hi>Pompey's</hi> ſupport, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from Croſſing his Suite to <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and the ſame reaſon made him ſeek his Alliance: He Married the Siſter of that great Man the ſame day that <hi>Pompey</hi> Marryed <hi>Caeſars</hi> Miſtreſs: <hi>Love,</hi> which had not ſo eaſily complyed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, but to triumph in the progreſs, would not let <hi>Hymen</hi> rob him of his Rites. <hi>Caeſar</hi> loves <hi>Murcia</hi> no leſs now ſhe is <hi>Pompeys</hi> Wife, then he had done before ſhe was ſo: Nor did <hi>Claudius</hi> believe himſelf more unhappy for ſeeing <hi>Pompeia</hi> in the Armes of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> want of opportunity only made ſome little change in their fortunes. <hi>Pompey</hi> was a Man of Authority, neceſſary to <hi>Caeſars</hi> Ambition; he durſt not let him ſuſpect he went to waite on him only to Court his Wife, and therefore reſtrained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94436:35"/>to which it was not ſeemly to admit Men; or, that they feared ſome eſcapes of joy repugnant to the <hi>Roman</hi> Auſterity, it was made death for any Man to be found at that Feaſt: <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe Soul was incapable of fear, he knew that improbable attempts ofteneſt eſcape with impunity, and reſolved to make uſe of this occaſion; There was a Cloſet in the Alcove of <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Bed, which anſwered by a private paire of Staires to a back door, which was very ſeldome opened; <hi>Caeſar</hi> took the Key of this door, and reſolving to ſlip by this way into his Wives Chamber, he writ to <hi>Murcia,</hi> that feigning her ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd at the Feaſt, ſhe ſhould deſire to repoſe her ſelf ſome few Moments on <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Bed: <hi>Murcia,</hi> who loved <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and well weighed the hazard of his enterprize, withſtood his reſolution with all her power; but <hi>Caeſar</hi> accuſing the faintneſs of her Love, that Reproach overcame all other conſiderations. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> left his houſe at the uſual time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he Supt at <hi>Pompeys</hi> to prevent all ſuſpition, he went thence to <hi>Cato</hi>'s, whither he knew his Brother-in-Law would not accompany him, becauſe <hi>Cato</hi>

Do not diſcompoſe your ſelf by theſe endeavours to eſcape me,</hi> added he, finding that this <hi>Murcia</hi> ſtrugled to get looſe from him, <hi>'Tis in your pleaſure to diſpoſe both of your deſtiny and mine, for you have an abſolute power over</hi> Caeſar. At that name of <hi>Caeſar, Murcia,</hi> or at leaſt the party he took for her, uſed redoubled endeavours to eſcape, and that with ſo much vehemence, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> for fear of hurting her was fain to let her go; <hi>Do,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>all that your cruelty can inſpire

               <hi>the greateſt injury he can receive, and that he has not the courage to revenge it; Thou mayeſt now talke whatever thou wilt, the diſcretion I owe to my Love ſubmits it ſelf to all Cenſures. Claudius</hi> went down the Privy-ſtaires, which were the ſame <hi>Albra</hi> had brought him in by; but, one of <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s Women being by chance in the Court near the foot of thoſe Staires ſeeing <hi>Claudius</hi> put out his light, as ſoon as he eſpy'd her, began to have ſome ſuſpition of the truth; She ſtop'd the diſguis'd Lover, demanding what he was, and whether he went; the confus'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer he gave, and the fulneſs of his voice made him known for a man. <hi>Aurelia</hi> had notice of the accident, ſhe cauſed the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to ceaſe, and ſending for Officers commanded <hi>Claudius</hi> to be deliver'd over to the <hi>Cenſor. Caeſar</hi> then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pretending to be run into the noiſe, and the fear he was in to be impeached in the Criminals Examination, obliging him to take him out of the hands of his Mother, he cauſed him to be carry'd to <hi>Cato</hi>'s, whoſe very near Kinſman he was. <hi>Aurelia</hi> could by no meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this exceſs of Mercy: <hi>You know not,</hi> ſaid ſhe to her Son, <hi>what kind of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94436:38"/>Man you ſave from the rigour of the Laws, he is your Wives Gallant: I have a long time taken notice that wherever they meet, they have obſerved each other with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure betraying too much love, and 'twas without doubt by her order he came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſguis'd in that manner:</hi> for, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Wife finding her ſelf indiſpoſed, and having deſired a moments repoſe on <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Bed, ſhe receiving the requeſt with ſo an unbecoming a manner, that I was forced to lead <hi>Murcia</hi> to mine. <hi>I found not your Wife there when I return'd into the Aſſenibly; I cauſed</hi> Albra <hi>to ſearch her, and having asked her why ſhe had ſo left the Feaſt, ſhe told me that ſhe had a little buſineſs in her Chamber; but I'le aſſure you ſhe lied not, ſhe had indeed great buſineſs there.</hi>

Now, that by the report of what had paſſed, ſhe underſtood 'twas a Rival defended <hi>Julius</hi> his heart againſt her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; ſhe gave looſe reines to all the fury, and all the Jealouſie a Womans breaſt was capable of conceiving: Nor was <hi>Caeſar</hi> leſs tormented within, though the cauſes of his trouble were different; his Spirit was fierce and delicate, he could not think of the affront he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without ſuch violent indignation as reach'd almoſt to Madneſs: But, that rage being balanc'd with what he ought to the honour of <hi>Murcia,</hi> and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he ſtood in of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s friendſhip, he run from thought to thought, and from deſperate reſolutions to the moſt pacifick deliberations, and not knowing preciſely what to determine on, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94436:39"/>himſelf the moſt miſerable man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: He paſt the reſt of the night walking in a diſconſolate manner in his Chamber, and aſſoon as it was day he went to <hi>Pompey</hi> to make Complaint of his Siſters demeanour. <hi>Pompey</hi> would not excuſe her, but knowing nothing more of her Crime then that <hi>Claudius</hi> was found diſguis'd like a Woman at the feaſt of the <hi>Good Goddeſs;</hi> he was of the mind ſhe could not therefore merit all thoſe reproaches wherewith <hi>Caeſar</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated her; he therefore urg'd him to ſay, whether he had any ſecret light touching that buſineſs which the reſt of the World knew not? <hi>No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in a perplexed manner, <hi>but it is not enough for the delicacy of my humor, that the Wife of</hi> Caeſar <hi>be free from crime, I would have her be ſo from Suſpition.</hi> Pompey us'd all his endeavours to appeaſe <hi>Caeſars</hi> anger; he told him, <hi>That in accidents of this nature, Husbands ought to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the beſt part of their tranquility, that nothing ſhould be believ'd but what was ſeen: And</hi> Caeſar (continued he) <hi>we ſhould in diſcretion ſee as little as we can; What advantage gain you in taking away your Wives Reputation? the wrong you do her
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94436:39"/>recoils on your ſelf; and if you drive on the buſineſs to a divorce of her, 'tis an even lay, you take another leſs honeſt then ſhe. Chance governs in all Marriages, and Women ſhould be choſen blindfold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe Learned Sentences they went together towards the Senate, they met <hi>Cato</hi> by the way. Though <hi>Pompey</hi> and he were enemies, yet they forbore not, on occaſion, to talk together. <hi>Cato</hi> joyned himſelf to the two Brothers in Law, and they proceeded all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Senate; whither, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was accoſted by an unknown perſon, who delivered him a Letter, and whiſpered him in the ear, <hi>That a fair Lady ſent it.</hi> He believed it came from <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and the preſence of <hi>Pompey</hi> made him bluſh. <hi>Cato</hi> who always diſtruſted his ambitious humor, and who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides naturally ſuſpitious, asked him what that Letter was. <hi>'Tis nothing,</hi> replied <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in ſomewhat a diſcompoſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>You ſeem to me too much condemned,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Cato, on ſo light a cauſe; that Letter certainly contains ſome attempts againſt the Commonwealth, and I ſummon you in your Countreys behalf to deliver it to be ſhown to the Senate. You are very troubleſome with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94436:40"/>your diſtruſts Cato,</hi> replied <hi>Caeſar. I ſwear to you by all our Houſhold-Gods, this Letter contains onely Family buſineſs, wherein</hi> Rome <hi>is not at all concerned. You may ſpeak truth,</hi> anſwered <hi>Cato</hi> haſtily; <hi>but</hi> Caeſar <hi>you here receive a Letter viſibly diſcompoſes you, and you refuſe to ſhow it, when you are preſſed to it. What have you ſo ſecret to treat of, which</hi> Rome <hi>may not know? She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts you with all her deſigns, enterpriſes nothing without conſulting you; and her glory, and her ſafety, are committed to your diſcretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This diſpute grew hotter, and <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> beginning to utter offenſive words, the Senate would know the difference. If <hi>Cato</hi> did calumniate <hi>Caeſar,</hi> it were fit he ſhould make him reparation, and if he ſpoke truth, it was of importance to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the matter: It was therefore thought convenient to ſee the Letter in queſtion, and <hi>Pompey</hi> was nominated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer of it. <hi>Caeſar</hi> who could not have any one he more ſuſpected, knowing <hi>Cato</hi> for a Wiſeman, and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Enemy; and chuſing rather to truſt his diſcretion, then any other, gave him the Letter, which occaſioned the diſpute; and declaring his intentions to be ſo pure, he doubted
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94436:40"/>not his very accuſers. He in generous terms, exhorted <hi>Cato</hi> to make no ill uſe of the ſecret he now extorted from him. <hi>Cato</hi> retired to a Window to read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter privately, and opening it found what follows.</p>

               <hi>Cato</hi> was diſtracted to find there his Siſters name, and giving ſome injurious words to the <hi>Praetor,</hi> which Hiſtory ſets down in expreſs terms, he flung out of the Senate in ſuch a huff, that his very countenance was changed. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was more ſurpriſed at the ſecond ſally, then he had been at the firſt, and following <hi>Cato</hi> to recover his Letter, he went along demanding of him, if he conſidered well what he did, and for what Reaſon he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94436:41"/>took ſo much intereſt in the concerns of his enemies. <hi>Cato</hi> would anſwer to none of theſe queſtions, but getting him home with a haſt outſtript <hi>Caeſars,</hi> he goes to add new fuel to <hi>Servilia</hi>'s indignation. <hi>Caeſar</hi> much troubled for the hard fate of his Letter, and willing by any means to retreive it, bethought himſelf of <hi>Cato</hi>'s ſiſter to aid him in this extremity, he knew that ſhe vehemently loved him; and though he were become unworthy of that love, by his neglect of it, yet he had learnt, that the moſt violent anger of that kind is blown away at the firſt appearance of a returning Heart. He writes to <hi>Servilia,</hi> proteſts that love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to his duty; and making a light apology for what was paſt, conjures her now to give him the opportunity of extending his Paſſion. <hi>Cato</hi> had given ſuch orders at home, this Letter could not be delivered, as it was addreſſed, it was in ſhort intercepted, and <hi>Caeſars</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, paſſing with <hi>Cato</hi> for a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in offending him, he reſolved to revenge the injury, by letting <hi>Pompey</hi> know the wrong <hi>Caeſar</hi> did his Siſter. The union of theſe two Brother in Laws had for a long time been an eyefore to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94436:41"/>
               <hi>Cato,</hi> and he had ſecretly ſought occaſions to reconcile himſelf to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and to convince him of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ambition, he now ſends for his friend <hi>Munatius,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing him what he had to do, he gave him the two Letters on which he ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his accuſation. This <hi>Munatius</hi> muſt ſurely be of a very inſinuating ſpirit, for he it was who had perſwaded <hi>Cato</hi> to lend his Wife for ſome years to <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and to take her again when <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was weary of her. He goes to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and aggravating <hi>Caeſars</hi> ingratitude, who after having been admitted into ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious an Alliance, had made himſelf unworthy of it by his diſſoyalty to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia. I know,</hi> added he, <hi>you love not</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>and I perceive you could ſcarce forbear laughing at the humorous part he played yeſterday in the Senate. Your factions are different, and in the intereſts you have to ſupport you, are ſo frequently of oppoſite judgments, none can conclude you other then enemies. But Sir, this ſort of hatred, though it may deſtroy Society, ſhould not hinder your eſteem for</hi> Cato, <hi>whilſt I am ſure</hi> Cato <hi>preſerves his for the</hi> Great Pompey. <hi>He is justly incenſed againſt</hi> Caeſar, <hi>you ought to contribute to his ſatisfaction, and beſides
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94436:42"/>thoſe Reaſons of Equity which are in common among all generous enemies, there are many particular ones to induce you to ſtop the courſe of this intrigue.</hi> Caeſar <hi>has eſpouſed your Siſter, the faults he commits by breach of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Faith, are of ill example to her, and perhaps the ſtory of the good Goddeſs, was but the reprizal of an offended Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> received <hi>Munatius</hi> advice, like one deſigned advantage by it, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him he would employ his credit with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to interrupt his commerce with <hi>Servilia;</hi> but in his Soul, he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing leſs then this Tyranny: He was a good and an eaſie Friend, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not into his Friends ſecrets farther then they deſired, and onely required from their friendſhip, a compliance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraint, he goes into his Wives Chamber, and tells her with much break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth into laughter, what <hi>Munatius</hi> had told him. <hi>Murcia</hi> found not the ſtory ſo pleaſant as it appeared to her Husband, ſhe often changed colour, during its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal; and reading <hi>Caeſars</hi> Letter with a grief, appeared to <hi>Pompey</hi> ſomewhat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. <hi>Why,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>do not you think it admirable that</hi> Cato, <hi>the wiſe</hi> Cato, <hi>ſhould draw a vexation upon himſelf, ſo little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94436:42"/>him? Had you ſeen with what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs he forced</hi> Caeſar <hi>to ſhew him</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia<hi>'s Letter, you could not read its contents without laughing as much as I do. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture is indeed ſomething extraordinary,</hi> replied <hi>Murcia; and if</hi> Caeſar <hi>had not been concerned in it. I ſhould have found pleaſure enough to ſee</hi> Gato's <hi>miſtruſt ſo puniſhed; but I have ſo much intereſt in what touches the Husband of your Siſter, that I cannot without grief inform my ſelf of the treaſon wherewith theſe Letters convince him. This kind of Treaſon wrongs not the reputation of a Gentleman,</hi> replied <hi>Pompey, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it eſtabliſhes and adds to it; their worth is judged of by the quality of their love; and the Siſter of</hi> Cato <hi>being emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both for Birth and Beauty, an intrigue with her cannot be diſhonorable to the Gallant.</hi> Aurelia <hi>may propheſie ſome misfortune to her Son, if ſhe hears he violates conjugal faith, and</hi> Pompeia <hi>may revenge her ſelf by ſome diſobedience; but theſe accidents a part (which as you can well judge) are not the moſt troubleſome of our life) I would give</hi> Caeſar <hi>as fair Joy for this conqueſt, as I would for that of the</hi> Gauls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> came in as <hi>Pompey</hi> finiſhed this diſcourſe, <hi>Murcia</hi> fearing ſhe ſhould not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94436:43"/>be able to maſter her Paſſion, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Lover, ſhe now believed falſe, retired into her Cloſet; and <hi>Pompey</hi> who was in a humor to be merry, putting on a grave countenance, which he had much a do to counterfeit. <hi>I thought,</hi> (ſays he to his Brother in Law) <hi>I had made my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo valuable to you, that you would not publickly have renounced it, as you have done: Had none but I known the wrong you do our family, perhaps my love had been great enough to have concealed your fault; but to make</hi> Cato <hi>a witneſs of it, and that I muſt hear from my enemies, the injuries you do our Alliance, is a thing,</hi> Caeſar, <hi>I could not expect from you, and what ſurpuſſes the moſt deteſtable ingratitude. Caeſar</hi> explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Murcia,</hi> what <hi>Pompey</hi> ſaid to him of <hi>Servilia,</hi> changed colour at every word, his fury to have been betrayed by <hi>Cato,</hi> the deſpair wherein he repreſented <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> in his mind, and the conſuſion he was in to find himſelf deſerving the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Pompey,</hi> brought a colour in his face mixt with ſhame and anger, that even changed the figure of his countenance. <hi>Pompey</hi> whoſe anger was counterfeit, and who knew nothing of what was in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Heart, had much ado to forbear laughing,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94436:43"/>he turned his head another way to ſpin out the Comedy; and complaining of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſilence, as a contempt that aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated his fault, he made him reſolve on a ſincere Confeſſion of his offence, and to ask pardon for what was yet onely in deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To take things in the utmoſt ſeverity</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the firſt ſteps towards an amorous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, are ſomewhat uneaſie to dainty minds, and ſo far I may be criminal towards you; for I acknowledge our friendſhip required me to be ſcrupulous even to Letters; but</hi> Pompey <hi>I loved before friendſhip impoſed on me the Law of not loving, my love fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not our alliance, on the contrary our alliance has put a bridle on my love; and that which the conſideration I had for you, has confined within the limits of Innocent favor, had, without doubt, made farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, had not reſpect to you extinguiſhed my flames for</hi> Murcia. <hi>Murcia,</hi> who from the Cloſet into which ſhe was retired, heard all was ſaid in the Chamber, when her name was pronounced, briskly ſallies forth. <hi>Say</hi> Servilia, Caeſar, (cried ſhe) <hi>your Tongue miſtakes your Heart, 'tis from the Siſter of</hi> Cato <hi>you received a Letter ſome days ſince, as you went to the Senate, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94436:44"/>not from the Wife of</hi> Pompey; <hi>and pray Sir take heed what you ſay for the future, and commit no more ſuch miſtakes.</hi> There needed no more to recal <hi>Caeſar</hi> into the right way of playing his game; <hi>Was it not</hi> Servilia, <hi>that I named,</hi> ſays he, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeming to be moved. <hi>No,</hi> ſaid <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> in an angry manner, <hi>'twas my name you pronounced, I ask your Pardon, Madam,</hi> continued <hi>Caeſar, the preſence of</hi> Pompey <hi>cauſed that miſtake: But Madam, you are too well known to your Husband to be alarm'd at that undue application. Your Vertue is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliſed, and this Letter,</hi> ſaid he, taking that <hi>Pompey</hi> held out of his hands, <hi>is an eaſie rectifier of all;</hi> with that he opened <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia</hi>'s Letter, and by it underſtanding part of the truth, ſaid all that a bold and wary Lover could do to draw himſelf out of the bryars: But <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſpirit was too ſearching to have the change put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with ſuch eaſe, he was dull and melancholly the reſt of that day, and at night recalling to mind <hi>Murcia</hi>'s trouble at the reading <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Letter, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his Gallant at <hi>Pompey</hi>'s firſt words, and his wives retiring, he drew thence two or three conjectures as juſt as they were grievous; he reſolved to ſee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94436:44"/>
               <hi>Servilia,</hi> to be by her enlightned in the obſcure ſence of her Letter. <hi>Aurelia</hi> who had ſome Alliance with <hi>Cato,</hi> would not engage in the animoſity of <hi>Pompey,</hi> but had entertained a civil commerce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her houſe and <hi>Servilia's. Pompey</hi> goes next morning to viſit his Siſter, and making a politick pretence to authoriſe a ſecret conference with <hi>Servilia,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages his Siſter, to oblige her to come to ſome place, where he might privately ſpeak with her. <hi>I would draw from her ſome light touching a deſign of</hi> Cato<hi>'s, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to my intereſts,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and of which, I believe his Siſter has ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Pompeia</hi> without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pompey</hi> ſpoke truth or diſſembled, cauſed one of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s People to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſent him to tell <hi>Servilia,</hi> ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired her company in a Garden <hi>Pompey</hi> had upon the <hi>Tiber,</hi> where there were many wonderful cloſe Alloys of great convenience. <hi>Servilia</hi> was at preſent there with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who by agreement with <hi>Murcia,</hi> endeavored to manage her, and judging this Garden of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed then any other place, to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes of <hi>Cato,</hi> had choſen thoſe walks for the interview. One of <hi>Servilia</hi>'s Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94436:45"/>who had received <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Meſſage to her Miſtreſs, ſeeing one of the <hi>Praetors</hi> people return, imagined him ſent to haſten <hi>Servilia. My Miſtreſs is gone,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ſhe is at</hi> Pompey<hi>'s Garden, at this very time, thou haſt nothing to do but return, and might have ſpared thy pains.</hi> The Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Pompeia</hi> with this Anſwer, it might have removed the ſuſpitions of <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſeeing ſo direct an appearance of intrigue with <hi>Servilia,</hi> which diſcharged <hi>Murcia</hi> from the concern. But this good Mans jealouſie was now grown to that exceſs, nothing could gain belief from him, but what his ſences demonſtrated, he comes with all haſt to the Garden, and informing himſelf from the Gardners where thoſe he ſought were, expreſly forbid the giving any notice of his arrival. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Servilia</hi> were under a Bower, covered with Roſes and Jeſſamines, made after the model of the Walks at <hi>Capua. Pompey</hi> ſlipt himſelf behind the thick Hedges, and getting ſoftly within reach of their voices, he heard <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſay to <hi>Servilia. You may eaſily judge, that if I had had any ſuſpition of the truth, I would never have given your Letter to</hi> Cato; <hi>it was my part onely to conceal it from his ſight, and</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:94436:45"/>Pompey <hi>was named by the Senate to read it. But who could ever have thought your goodneſs, was proof againſt all my ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and that after ſo great an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, never merited by you, you ſhould yet vouchſafe to remember</hi> Caeſar. <hi>I complain not of your indiſcretion,</hi> ſaid <hi>Servilia, I loved with ſo much affection, I was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed my love ſhould be known; when a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is extream, it ſlights vain decencies, and they love weakly whoſe diſcretion over-rules their deſires. Tell it in open Senate, that</hi> Servilia <hi>loves you, I conſent; but then make your ſelf worthy of that love, by ſacrificing to it your Paſſion for</hi> Murcia. <hi>I have told you already,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caeſar,</hi> interrupting her, <hi>that I loved</hi> Murcia, <hi>even before I knew what love was; this impreſſion on my firſt inclinations, cannot be effaced.

            <p>The voice of <hi>Murcia</hi>'s Husband, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſoon knew, threw him into a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94436:47"/>miſerable confuſion, he remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable on the Bank where he ſat, and <hi>Servilia,</hi> judging of the love he bore her Rival, by the perplexity the conſideration wrought, conceived a malign joy at the adventure which ſhe could not diſſemble. <hi>You know too much not to know all,</hi> ſaid ſhe to <hi>Pompey, who now entred the Bower. 'Tis true</hi> Caeſar <hi>loves</hi> Murcia, <hi>and according to all appearance is not hated; but Sir, among people ſo intimate, as</hi> Caeſar <hi>and you, there ſhould nothing be reſerved. You are maliciouſly diſpoſed,</hi> ſaid <hi>Caeſar,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, <hi>you know in your own Soul,</hi> Murcia <hi>has reſerved to her Husband alone, all eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial things; and I ſwear to you</hi> Pompey, <hi>by all that is moſt Sacred in Heaven and Earth, and as a Man that makes Profeſſion of Honor, That I never obtained any Grace from your Wife, might alarm a Rational Man. I may have had ſome pretence to hope it, but whether it were Chance croſt me, or the addreſs and management of</hi> Murcia, <hi>that hope never had effect. I will believe you</hi> Caeſar, replied <hi>Pompey</hi> very coldly, <hi>but as it is not enough for you that</hi> Pompeia <hi>be exempt from crime, unleſs ſhe be from ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo 'tis too little for me, though</hi> Murcia <hi>continue chaſt, if ſhe can conceive a thought
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:94436:47"/>of not being ſo. Caeſar</hi> took <hi>Pompey</hi> at the rebound, as he had done him before, he rehearſed all thoſe judicious Sentences he had cited to him on the diſguiſe of <hi>Claudius;</hi> but Counſels of what nature ſoever they be, loſe their efficacy with thoſe that gave them, when they paſs through a third Mouth. <hi>Pompey</hi> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated <hi>Murcia,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of <hi>Pompeys</hi> rigor repudiated <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia.</hi> This diſ-union became publick, <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> were divided with it: <hi>Cato</hi> made advantage of their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he had propoſed, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf with <hi>Pompey,</hi> became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one of the moſt obſtinate Enemies to <hi>Caeſar. Murcia</hi>'s Gallant, mad that his good intentions had ſuch ill ſucceſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged the Caprichios of Fortune on the indiſcreet <hi>Claudius,</hi> he exaſperated <hi>Cicero</hi> againſt him, who accuſed him in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and freely proſecuted his profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the feaſt. This accuſation forced <hi>Claudius</hi> to withdraw from <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> not content with this voluntary exile, had in all likelihood purſued his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his ruine, had not his voyage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the Victories he there gained, diverted his dire reſolutions.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:94436:48"/>
            <p>He had many gallant intrigues, during the ten years, that War continued: Love followed him among Strangers, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him not even in the Field of Battel, he found Beauties among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as perfect as thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> he loved on the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and love left him not when he paſſed that River, he judged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ladies worthy the reputation they have gained in the whole World. He dedicated ſome time to the delights of <hi>Capua,</hi> like another <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and his adventures with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> are famous in all Hiſtory; but the life of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is fertile enough in ſuch adventures, to afford ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94436:49"/>between theſe two great Men a ſolid and violent Friendſhip, not expiring but with their lives: They were together in the ſame Garden where</hi> Pompey <hi>over-heard the Diſcourſe between</hi> Caeſar <hi>and</hi> Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, <hi>and the ſight of the Bower where it was held calling into</hi> Pompeys <hi>mind the troubles he felt during that entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſtrange kind of Madneſs, (<hi>ſaid he to</hi> Cato) is that point of honour a Husband places in his Wives Chaſtity! Why ſhould the glory of a man depend on a Caprichio, of which he is not Maſter? When a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral flies out of terrour of his Enemy 'tis a perſonal remiſsneſs, and 'tis fit that he who commits the fault ſhould ſuffer the diſgrace; but when my Wife acts a Gallantry, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute neither by Connivance nor Counſell, and yet the whole ſhame of the Action lights on my head. Who told you ſo (<hi>ſaid</hi> Cato, <hi>interrupting him</hi>) I perceive not that an honeſt man is leſt eſteemed by reaſonable People, becauſe his Wife is non exactly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that we call honour in her Sex. I am ſure he ought not to be, <hi>reply'd</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, but yet Cuſtome gives Authority to this injustice, and the title given to a Husband whoſe Wife is unchaſt, is one of the greateſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94436:49"/>Ignominies can be thrown on him. Hold, hold, <hi>ſaid</hi> Cato, <hi>interruping him, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his head,</hi> I eſteem my ſelf not a ruſh the leſs for having ſeen <hi>Martia</hi> in <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius</hi> his Armes, and would take her again when forſaken by her Lover as the relict of one of my beſt friends, if at leaſt I found any benefit by doing it. This is not the ſort of moderation that ſurprizes me, <hi>reply'd</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, <hi>Martia</hi> ſhould not be lookt upon by you as a diſloyal Woman, you ſurrendred her to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> by contract in form of Law, and were forced to make uſe of all the power you had over her, to oblige her to ratifie your Gift. All things in this life wear two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Pompey,</hi> (<hi>reply'd</hi> Cato) and they ſhow to the good or bad but juſt as the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of man knows how to hold the light to them; Liſten to what I never told any but <hi>Munatius,</hi> and judge of the ſincerity of my returne in friendſhip to you, by the ſecret wherewith I ſhall intruſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martin</hi> is (as you well know Sir) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one of the faireſt perſons of the world; I loved her dearly; and thought ſhe loved me as well: The charmes of her Soul had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and gave new life in my heart to thoſe flames which Marriage uſually extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes; I found <hi>Martia</hi> more worthy of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94436:50"/>love when I abſolutely and perfectly knew her, then when decency and good manners conceal'd a part of her merit; and, if the words of a Woman may have any credit with a well-grounded underſtanding, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> acknowledg'd to have found in me all I diſcover'd in her: I am in the exterior ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, but this ſeverity is only in appearance; I am in private ſociable, and love divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment like other men; and <hi>Martia</hi> us'd to tell me, I prov'd a more loving Husband then ſhe durſt hope for when I was but her Lover, ſhe would often ſay, that that <hi>Cato</hi> which permitted himſelf to be ſeen by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friends, was not that <hi>Cato</hi> ſhow'd himſelf to the Senate and Common-wealth, and methought ſhe ſpoke truth. I juſtifi'd her opinion with all the complacencies a wife could expect from the beſt of Husbands; and thoſe who are perſwaded they deſerve any ones kindneſs, eaſily believe they poſſeſs it: I had an abſolute confidence in <hi>Martia</hi>'s faith, ſhe might have betray'd me before my own eyes without fear of conviction, ſhe perceiv'd without doubt this advantage, and would not let it lie fallow. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> is a handſome Man, his riches vaſt, which make his expence eaſie, and Women natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally weak are ſooner taken with glittering
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94436:50"/>then ſolidity: <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was captiv'd by <hi>Martia</hi>'s beauty, and <hi>Martia</hi> yielded her ſelf to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> gayety; diſpence with me from telling you how they did declare their thoughts, I have not entred into ſo nice a deduction of the Story: <hi>Martia</hi> has betray'd me, ſhe is at preſent the Wife of <hi>Hortenſius;</hi> great things alwayes preſuppoſe the leſs, and when effects ſpeak, a diſcourſe of the wayes is needleſs. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> got admiſſion into my Houſe by becoming a feigned ſervant to my younger Siſter <hi>Portia,</hi> being a perſon both of great honour and as great riches, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions were eaſily liſtned to, but <hi>Druſus Livius</hi> our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, under whom we had all been bred, and whom we reſpect as a Father, is a Man infinitely ſcrupulous in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of his times, and would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to marry <hi>Portia</hi> the younger before <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia</hi> her elder Siſter; you know <hi>Servilia,</hi> and many other perſons know her as well as you, and that Matches for Maids of her humour are rare to be found out. <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was therefore forced to prepare himſelf for patience; He at firſt made it mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, but has ſince acknowledged to <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> that it was a difficulty he foreſaw, and for the reaſon of which alone he choſe to ask <hi>Portia</hi> rather then <hi>Servilia.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94436:51"/>of this ſuppoſed Lover appeared to us as ſincere as they were falſe, we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſupport his patient expectation with a very ſtrait familiarity, he had the ſame liberty in my houſe and my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncles as if he had been my own brother, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſeem'd to behave himſelf more and more worthy of the love he profeſsed to my Siſter; My Wife grew not at all Jealous of him, ſhe had ſo well made up conditions of accord with her Lover in that point, that whatever was done for <hi>Portia</hi> was placed to the account of <hi>Martia;</hi> but, it happened not ſo, nor was ſhe ſo juſt with him in the caſe of <hi>Lucia</hi> Daughter of <hi>Druſus;</hi> ſhe there lookt upon as ſeeds of Love, what was indeed but a ſimple Civility; and theſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitions troubling and disturbing her humour, which was naturally ſomewhat imperious, ſhe writ to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> in theſe termes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Believe I deſerve to be beloved, <hi>Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and that opinion makes me eaſily believe you do love me: I have done no leſs for you. Theſe diſpoſitions of our hearts may as you perhaps think raiſe ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in mine at the ſight of your inconſtancy; but <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> expect not that glory: I ſhall behold your change with as much tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94436:51"/>as ſcorn, and 'tis by that effect of my courage I deſign to make you know what you loſe when you loſe.</p>

               <hi>She was doubtleſs about to write the Name of</hi> Martia, <hi>but I gave her not time; I had been at the houſe</hi> Druſus <hi>had built in the Marches of</hi> Ancona, <hi>and had once deſigned to ſpend ſome time there, but an oppreſſing Melancholly making me apprehend ſomething had happened to</hi> Martia, <hi>that fear made me poſt home to rid me of the Suſpition of it, and taking upon me the humour of Gallant, that I might ſurprize my Wife with my arrival, I had forbid my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple giving her notice; I ſurprized her indeed as I deſigned, but alaſs not with ſuch a ſurprize as my blind paſſion flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; ſhe turn'd her head as I entred into the Chamber, and I obſerv'd a ſtrange kind of trouble in her face, I paid her as much reſpect as I ſhould have done reproach, taking for a ſign of love what proceeded from another principle: I cannot remember I ever carreſſed her with more obliging kindneſſes then at this return. She might have hid the</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſhe had writ if ſhe would; the joy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94436:52"/>of ſeeing again my</hi> Martia <hi>ſo tranſported me, that I neither obſerved what ſhe was doing, nor ſhould not have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of whatever ſhe had pleaſed to do; but, whether ſhe imagined me more quick-ſighted, or whether being one of the moſt witty Women in the World, ſhe apprehended cunning was never better concealed then under the cloak of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</hi> I was, <hi>ſaid ſhe to me ſmiling,</hi> in a pleaſant employ when you juſt entred, I was writing a Love Letter. <hi>I ſmil'd in a careleſs confident way at this diſcourſe, which was ſoon obſerved by my Wife,</hi> I ſee you believe me not, <hi>continu'd ſhe,</hi> but read what is in that Paper and you will perceive I tell no untruth: <hi>I was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by</hi> Martia<hi>'s wiſdome, that I was not at all moved by this</hi> Letter, <hi>but as it was, and had been my divertiſement to draw new aſſurances of the happineſs I thought I enjoy'd; I feign'd ſome amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at it, and asked</hi> Martia <hi>what that</hi> Letter <hi>ſignify'd? ſhe took a Pen, without giving me an anſwer, and ſetting down the name of</hi> Portia <hi>where hers ſhould have ſtood,</hi> See there, <hi>ſaid ſhe, ſhowing it me,</hi> the reſolution of the Riddle, I went yesterday into your Siſters Cloſet, when ſhe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94436:52"/>was not there, a Letter dictated much after this rate lay on the Table, I read it, and found the Contents ſo ſingular, that I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to preſerve it in my memory to ſhow you at your coming home; <hi>but added ſhe, ſeeing me begin to look ſerious,</hi> do not diſcloſe my theft leſt you make me fall out with <hi>Portia.</hi> I will not ſpeak of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to my Siſter, <hi>reply'd I,</hi> there is nothing in it but is authorized both by <hi>Drufus</hi> orders and my own, but I will adviſe <hi>Hortenſius</hi> to be more Regular in his conduct, his ſuite to <hi>Portia</hi> has gone now too farr not to have its full effect, and if it be true that he has given her any juſt cauſe of complaint, I ſhall not be ſatisfy'd with thoſe excuſes wherewith ſuch lightneſses are ordinarily colour'd. Martia <hi>told me it was not convenient for me to concern my ſelf in this buſineſs; that it was a little quarrel between Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which Love would conclude upon the firſt interview.</hi> I vallue not Love at all, <hi>ſaid I interrupting her,</hi> Hortenſius paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for my Siſter is an affair too ſerious to be mixed with the revolutions of Gallants intrigues: <hi>And thereupon whatever</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia <hi>could ſay to ſtop me, I went directly to ſeek</hi> Hortenſius, <hi>he was walking alone near the Tribunal for Orations.</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94436:53"/>
               <hi>ſaid I, with a compoſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> they ſeldome go unpuniſh'd who make ſport of Men of my ranck; I never ſollicited you to love <hi>Portia,</hi> the propoſitions were made by your ſelf; and, without too much boaſting my race and my authority, <hi>Druſus</hi> believ'd he honour'd you in accepting you for his Nephew; and yet I am inform'd that you treat of this affair as a trifle, and intend to make a matter of ſport of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of your word with the Siſter of <hi>Cato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hortenſius, <hi>not a little diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd</hi>) I make a trifle of my Engagements with your family? Pray Sir, from vvhom have you advice carries ſo little ſence with it? From <hi>Portia</hi> her ſelf <hi>(reply'd I)</hi> and, to ſhow you I ſay nothing without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, read this Letter, and judge if I am informed of your deportment herein. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> changed collour, <hi>ſurpriz'd as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> to receive from my hand a Love-Letter from my Wife.</p>
            <p>The Perſon that gave you this Letter, <hi>ſaid he, turning a little his head,</hi> has a mind to create mirth to himſelf at your expence, it comes not from <hi>Portia.</hi> I know it, <hi>(ſaid I)</hi> but its being in <hi>Martia's</hi> hand changes nothing of the thing, 'tis ſufficient that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94436:53"/>Letter is coppied from one, you have, or ſhould have received this morning from my Siſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Had I known then what I have ſince,</hi> Hortenſius <hi>his very looks would have told me what he thought whilſt I thus diſcourſed; but, at that preſent, I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted all his changes of countenance to his confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You alarme your ſelf without reaſon, <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> I have not in my nature ſuch lightneſs as I am ſuſpected with; I love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what I have loved, and what I ſhall love till I die: this is an aſſurance of which I conjure you to become my ſecurity, and that you may without ſcruple do me that ſervice, I call all the gods to witneſs I ſpeak truth, and may they puniſh me in your ſight if I do not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I did what he deſired without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I did it, and relating faithfully all this diſcourſe to</hi> Martia, <hi>gave her freſh aſſurances of the love and conſtancy of her Gallant: I remember there eſcaped her from time to time little effluctions of joy, which ſhe could ſcarce reſtrain within the limits of a ſmile, but I made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on them. She took upon her to relate to</hi> Porcia <hi>what had paſſed between</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:94436:54"/>Hortenſius <hi>and me; and, when I offer'd to eaſe her of that recital, ſhe perſwaded it would not be convenient for me to concerne my ſelf in that commerce:</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your countenance of authority with your Siſters, <hi>ſaid ſhe,</hi> you know not what need there may be of it; it is not fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too familiar with perſons we would pretend to a right of Commanding; and, if you'l be adviſed by me, I will tell <hi>Portia</hi> that you are ignorant of the liberty ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes of writing to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and make her apprehenſive of your knowledge of it. I approv'd <hi>Martia's</hi> Counſel, and prais'd it, becauſe I thought it Judicious. You then return'd from your <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Victories, and the great actions you had done in that part of the World, having made a triumph a debt to you, you yet thought you ought ſome recompence to the applauſe of the People. You ſhow'd them a fight of wild Beaſts, <hi>Martia</hi> could not be preſent at this Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſhe had got a ſlip which confin'd her to her bed, and my Siſters ſeldome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in publick but in her company, ſtaid likewiſe with her. I know not whether her jealouſie were renewed by ſome new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> for <hi>Lucia;</hi> or, if finding me ſo perfect in the part I had
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94436:54"/>play'd upon her Letter, ſhe thought it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to make me play it over again: But ſhe told me that very morning of the ſpectacle, that ſhe ſuſpected <hi>Lucia</hi> was become the object of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> new inclinations, that ſhe had obſerved ſome favorable glances paſs between them; and adding, it was fit to be ſearched into, and not ſuffer him to be in treaty at once, with my Siſter, and my Coſin, ſhe engaged me to obſerve that day the carriage of her lover; ſhe had reaſon to be well ſatisfied with my report of it. The Officers who appoint the Seats in the Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatres, had placed <hi>Hortenſius</hi> in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the young Men of our Family, part of which he was already reputed, and ſide by ſide with <hi>Lucia,</hi> he loudly demanded another Seat; but not obtaining it from the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, who ſhow but little tractableneſs on theſe occaſions, he affected an indifference with <hi>Lucia</hi> almost amounting to incivility, ſhe ſpoke to him twice or thrice, and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her without looking at her, I obſerved more plainly how he ſhun'd giving her his hand to help her down from the Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</p>
            <p>I brought this good news to <hi>Martia,</hi> and not content to have done ſuch a ſervice for her Gallant to her, the next morning I did
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94436:55"/>the like for her to him, I found him at <hi>Cicero's,</hi> whom I went to pay a viſit to, on the marriage of his Daughter with <hi>Lentulus,</hi> I took him aſide. The Sacrifice, ſaid I, you yeſterday offered to <hi>Portia,</hi> will not be loſt to you, I obſerved all your coldneſs to <hi>Lucia,</hi> and have deſired <hi>Martia</hi> to acquaint your Miſtreſs with it. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> lookt at me in a way that has ſince explained to me what I then knew not. You muſt not be concerned at my obſervance, continued I, I was a ſecret Spie upon you, <hi>Martia</hi> had for my Sisters ſake enjoyned me to take ſome heed to your actions, I have given her a good account, and am confident, you will perceive it the first diſcourſe you have with <hi>Portia. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> could not contain himſelf to ſee me ſo exceſſive a Wittal, but burst out into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent laughter, till perceiving I began to look grave upon it, and by my countenance appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the ſally. I ask your pardon <hi>(ſaid he in retiring)</hi> I know the reſpects ought to be had to your wiſdom; but it is ſo pleaſant to me, to hear what I now hear from you, that my weak Sence could not reſtrain it ſelf at this circumſtance. I heard after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that he went directly from <hi>Cicero</hi>'s to my Houſe, and let me beg you to repreſent to your ſelf, the Scene he had there to play
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94436:55"/>with <hi>Martia</hi> on the ſcore of my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>This intrigue laſted all the time of my Voyage to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and would have laſted ſtill for ought I know, if the danger into which I was thrown ſome days after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, had not furniſhed me with an occaſion to open my eyes. You may remember well, that thinking my ſelf obliged to favor <hi>Domitian,</hi> my particular friend, and now <hi>Portia's</hi> Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, I undertook to have him preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you to the Conſulate. I brought him to the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> where you know the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is made, and carried on his intereſts with ſo much heat, that your party began a diſturbance, a tumult aroſe, and I was in danger of my life, I received a wound with an Arrow in my right arm; I perceived not my ſelf hurt, during the heat of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, but our faction yielding under the power of yours; and being conſtrained to ſave my ſelf by thoſe little by-ways that abut upon the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> I there began to feel the ſmart I remembred <hi>Martia</hi>'s Nurſe lived near that place, and into her Houſe I went to bind up my wound; the Woman grew pale at ſight of me, which I thought might proceed from her, being frightned at ſight of my Blood. This
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94436:56"/>is nothing my good friend, ſaid I, give me onely a piece of Linnen to make me a Roller: The little houſe wherein this Woman dwelt, contained onely a very ſmall Hall where I was, and another Room wherein ſhe lay, and kept her Cheſts. Alaſs Sir, ſaid ſhe, half distracted, I have not a Rag to give you, all I have is in that little Room you ſee, of which my Husband has carried out the Key. I told her ſhe must ſend for a Smith, ſhe ſaid there was none thereabouts: I bled vehemently, and began to find my ſelf grow weak, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to break open the door, which not being very ſtrong, was no hard matter to do; but I had no more need of any Linnen to ſtanch my Blood. What I beheld at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that door, ſeiſed me with ſuch a Palſie, you might have cut all my Veins, and not let out a drop. There was my diſloyal <hi>Martia</hi> ſhut up with <hi>Hortenſius;</hi> the confuſion the ſight of me wrought in them, appeared to me a guilty diſtraction. I ſaw enough for any Husband that loved his Wife, and I believed I ſaw more then I did. Ah <hi>Pompey</hi> 'tis in vain that love of our ſelves makes us aſpire to the Philoſophical inſenſibility; which lifts up the Wiſe Man above all Accidents; Men are but Men, and what ever care they take to raiſe themſelves above Nature, the firſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94436:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>movers will ſtill keep their courſe. I fell into a ſeat that ſtood by chance behind me, and ſometimes looking on <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on <hi>Martia,</hi> I ſought in their eyes that which would have made me mad to find, and perſwading my ſelf of my misfortune, without being willing to believe it, I forced my ſelf to think that a Dream, which the impreſſion of my grief, aſſured me, was too much a truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martia,</hi> not able to endure my ſight, went out without having power to ſpeak one word, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> followed her example, and my Fury increaſing, as my ſurpriſe grew leſs, I was about to run into the utmoſt extremities, if <hi>Munatius,</hi> who followed me at ſome distance, had not come in to the releif of my decaying Prudence; he found me ſo changed, that he believed me more wounded then I was, he ſet himſelf to comfort me, but kindly repulſing him with my hand, I conjured him not to think of my wound, and told him it was become the leaſt of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. He attributed this Deſpair, to the ill ſucceſs of my undertaking, and compoſing his countenance to gravity began to up braid me with weakneſs.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:94436:57"/>
            <p>How, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> can the election of one Conſul for another, put <hi>Cato</hi> into ſuch a dumps? What is become of his ſo much boaſted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage? Return to your ſelf <hi>Cato,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are accomptable to Poſterity, for the eſteem which <hi>Rome</hi> has given you. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>replied I feebly,</hi> that 'tis an Election puts me into the deſpair you find me, but alaſs it is not that of a new Conſul. At that word I grew ſenceleſs, but <hi>Munatius</hi> forgetting no offices of a true friend, to give me what aſſiſtance was neceſſary, I ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. My Wound was dreſt, for it ſeems <hi>Martia</hi> was run out onely to fetch a Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and <hi>Munatius</hi> having ſent for a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they carried me home, <hi>Martia</hi> followed me at a diſtance, bath'd in her tears for what had hapned to her. The People looked upon them as proceeding from an effect of conjugal Love, though they had a quite contrary cauſe, and praiſing her for what merited eternal blame, 'twas from this action ſhe gained that reputation of Vertue with which <hi>Rome</hi> has favored her. She durſt not ſee me neither that day, nor many following, but intruſted <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> with Juſtification. She proteſted that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was in the Houſe without being ſent for, and if ſhe ſwore truth, ſhe was not reſolved to ſpeak to him, when ſhe had ſeen
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94436:57"/>him, but onely to break off all commerce for the future. She acknowledged ſhe had been ſenſible of his merits, and declared likewiſe to <hi>Munatius</hi> all I have told you of the ſecret of the intrigue; but ſhe proteſted that ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility had ſtill been kept within the bounds of deſire, without ever coming to act. I ſhould poſſibly have become leſs ſevere in time <hi>(add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe)</hi> had I given my ſelf over to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of my heart, that ſecreet eſteem which I diſpenſed with, had gained more power then I perceived or thought of; and it was to reduce it to its duty that I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding <hi>Hortenſius</hi> my ſight, when <hi>Cato</hi> ſurpriſed us together, ſwear on my part, That all our diſcource tended to this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if the ſincerity you may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Confeſſions I make you, deſerve any truſt with you, procure me the favor of <hi>Cato,</hi> and be aſſured he ſhall never have cauſe to repent it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Munatius</hi> acquitted himſelf faithfully of the Commiſſion he had received, he endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to juſtifie what was paſt, and forgot no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make me hope better for the future; but both his Zeal and his Eloquence were fruitleſs. I had loved <hi>Martia</hi> too well to be reclaimed from a ſuſpition that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed me; I would repudiate her, and had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94436:58"/>been hurried to ſome more memorable revenge had I been governed by my own thoughts: For I imagined in theſe occaſions, my fury was to take its dimentions from my love, and that the life of <hi>Martia</hi> was the onely fit ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Paſſion I had for her. <hi>Muna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> who was not of my mind, oppoſed my Severity with all the Reaſons he could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>The Evil, <hi>Cato, ſaid he,</hi> which you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, is not an evil in effect, 'tis onely a Chimera founded upon your imagination. <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was as much beloved by your Wife before your Voyage to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as he is at preſent. If that Mans happineſs were to be regarded by you as a real evil, you would have felt the rigor of it more then, than now; yet you then thought to enjoy a perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and now account your ſelf the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate of all Men. Are your Wives merits at all angmented? Are the Laws of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age changed? In ſhort, What is happened ſhould disturb your mind more now, then at that time? I know now my misfortunes, and I could wiſh to be ignorant of them, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I very ſadly.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, <hi>continued</hi> Munatius, that your grief is onely a fancy, you are wounded now at this time I ſpeak to you; 'twould be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94436:58"/>in vain to conceal your Wound from you; you ſee it, you feel it, and 'tis that we may call a true grief; but to give that name to a thing you have born ſeveral years without being ſenſible of it; believe me, <hi>Cato</hi> is to ſubvert all Rules of Philoſophy. I could no longer hear theſe Arguments, <hi>Martia</hi> had betrayed me, and I would be revenged, and whatever withſtood my vengeance, ſeemed contrary to Reaſon. <hi>Munatius</hi> bethought himſelf of a ſecret to reclaim my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he feigned to ſubmit to my obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; and propoſing to me the Marriage of <hi>Hortenſius</hi> with <hi>Martia,</hi> as a puniſhment of their crime, perſwaded me I might better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my ſelf this way then any other. The jealouſie of Husbands never breaks forth, <hi>ſays he,</hi> but to their ſhame and diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their violence aggravates their grief, and their fury ill trained in the art of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, ſerves onely to adorn that triumph it would prevent; let not <hi>Hortenſius</hi> have the glory to paſs in <hi>Rome</hi> for the favored Gallant of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Wife, the opinion had of Mans happineſs, is often more eſſential then happineſs it ſelf. Why ſhould you procure it for your rival? Rather make him ſhare the danger to which he has expoſed you, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94436:59"/>at beſt no better then <hi>Cato. Martia</hi> will doubtleſs treat him as ſhe has treated you, or were he ſo happy to eſcape it, he will at leaſt feel the diſcontent to imagine you deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe <hi>Martia,</hi> ſince you quit her to him; that very thought will leſſen his happineſs. 'Tis ſmall ſatisfaction to the vanity of mankind, to be themſelves perſwaded of the value of what they poſſeſs: If all the world think it not precious, and your ſeeming indifference creating a real diſguſt in the heart of this new Husband; he will be the revenger of <hi>Martia</hi>'s diſloyalty, whilſt ſhe revenges you on <hi>Hortenſius</hi> raſhneſs, I ſurrendred to theſe Reaſons, and <hi>Munatius</hi> undertaking the management of it, that ſo ſingular Marriage which Antiquity has no example for; and which, I believe will be as rare in times to come, was concluded in the manner I have told you.</p>
            <p>I ſigned to my Wives Contract, <hi>Hortenſius</hi> received her from my hand, as if ſhe had been my Daughter; and they lived as peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably together, as if I had been dead, or <hi>Martia</hi> never the Wife of <hi>Cato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And would you take this Wife again, <hi>cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Pompey, <hi>when</hi> Cato <hi>had finiſhed his ſtory,</hi> I would neither take her, nor any
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94436:59"/>other; if I could diſpence with it, <hi>replied</hi> Cato. But ſuppoſe I were neceſſitated to marry, and that <hi>Martia</hi> would return to me, ſhe has given me ſuch prejudice againſt all her Sex, that I believe all Women equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unperfect; and if misfortune on misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune muſt come, that we are prepared for, is more ſupportable then that ſurpriſes us. I know not, <hi>replied</hi> Pompey, <hi>interrupting him,</hi> Whether the jealouſie of Lovers be more violent then that of Husbands? But <hi>Flora</hi> found not me ſo tractable as <hi>Martia</hi> is like to find you. Pray, <hi>ſaid</hi> Cato, ſince we are upon the recital of theſe ſecret intrigues, let me hear the ſum of that ſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flora</hi> was but a Curtizan, but by her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty became ſo famous, that her love to you is none of the leaſt preſents you have received from your good Fortune; and the ſecret of your breach with her, has come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſo few, that I ſhall be highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged if you intruſt me with it.</p>
            <p>I care not for falling into that Diſcourſe, <hi>replied</hi> Pompey, it is not for <hi>Flora</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and though 'tis true, ſhe was but a Curtizan, yet I once ſo dearly loved her, I ſtill preſerve a reſpect for her; but it is fit I ſacrifice ſomething to the deſires of <hi>Cato,</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:94436:60"/>nor ſhall it ever be ſaid I refuſed the firſt mark of friendſhip demanded after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
            <p>'Tis difficult to define, that Love agrees with my Nature, it has all the violencies of debauchery, and yet has ever been restrained within the bounds of Vertue. 'Tis a conjugal tie muſt put a ſtop to my Heart; and where other Mens deſires enter into their Tomb, and are buried, mine receive Spring and Life. I ſhowed ſuch overflowings of Paſſion to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtia,</hi> my firſt Wife, That People of my Age reproached me with it, as an extremity of weakneſs. I had been no leſs kind to <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Daughter, had I had time to have perceived I was her Husband; and the diſloyal <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> will aſſure all the World, that it was not any coldneſs or indifference of mine inſpired her with the deſign of betraying me. Such a particular inclination agreed not with the title of Curtizan, which we cannot diſpence with the giving to <hi>Flora;</hi> but could I at that time have foreſeen, ſhe would ever have deſerved it, ſhe ſhould never have been the Miſtreſs of <hi>Pompey;</hi> but ſhe tendred her ſelf to my hcart in ſuch honeſt appearances, that they overcame all ſcruples.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:94436:60"/>
            <p>I was one day with <hi>Caecilius Metellus,</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> which was then to be dedicated, and to take care of its adorning, <hi>Metellus</hi> had Commiſſion from the Senate; he diſcharged his trust with as much care as magnificence, and that I might be a witneſs of it, he had then carried me into the Temple: I there beheld many Pictures of an exquiſite perfection, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, one of the Conception of the Twins, where <hi>Leda</hi> was repreſented ſo fair, it was impoſſible to look on her, and not envy the divine Swan that enjoyed her. The Painter who drew this piece, ſaid I to <hi>Metel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> had his fancy very excellent, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; it were to be wiſht Nature were as perfect in her Lineaments, we ſhould not then ſee ſo many ill faces as we daily do. Nature deſerves all the praiſes you give the Painter, <hi>replied</hi> Metellus, that face of <hi>Leda</hi>'s is taken from a young <hi>Roman,</hi> whoſe Beauty far exceeds that repreſentation you there ſee.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible, cried I, that there can be a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Rome,</hi> as fair as that painting, and ſhe not be as famous as the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and other Singularities of the City?</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:94436:61"/>
            <p>The young <hi>Flora</hi> whom this Picture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, <hi>anſwered</hi> Metellus, is of ſo mean a Birth, that ſhe has been as it were buried in that obſcurity, ſhe is onely the daughter of a Mechanick; and if he had not formerly wrought in my Houſe, <hi>Flora</hi> had been as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me as to all other people of quality; but <hi>Pompey,</hi> that low Birth has not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoil'd <hi>Flora</hi> of a great Soul: 'Tis a ſmall matter to ſee this Portraict, and to know that it flatters not the Original. I will tell you, to perfect her deſcription, that I have loved this Maid for above two years, and that there are no marks of Love capable to beget a ſence of it, in perſons of her Character and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which ſhe has not received of me. I load her with preſents, I maintain the whole Family, and would inrich it for ever, if <hi>Flora</hi> would but comply with my deſires; but imperious as ſhe is, ſhe diſdains all my offers, and ſtands more on her Beauty, then I can, either on my Birth or Quality. She believes ſhe ſhould honor me in accepting me for her Husband, if my Paſſion could carry me to that extravagance.</p>
            <p>Flora <hi>entred the Temple as</hi> Metellus <hi>ended his Diſcourſe, ſhe came to ſit for ſome touches of a Picture wherein</hi> Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneſtra
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94436:61"/>
               <hi>was repreſented under ſome of her Features.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proteſt I was dazled with the Beauty of the Maid, and if I may ſay it, ſhe thought me not unworthy to be conſidered, ſhe bluſht as ſoon as her eyes met with mine, ſhe looked earneſtly at me when I feigned to look off her, and ſhe ſeem'd troubled to turn away, when I ſurpriſed her with a glance. I prais'd her Beauty exceedingly, and I told <hi>Metellus</hi> he had adminiſtred a neceſſary preſervative, when he had told me of her cruelty; ſhe bravely defended her ſelf from that quality, and told <hi>Metellus</hi> in a pretty ſcornful way, that of ten the title of Cruelty was given to what was but a reſult of right Reaſon; and at the pronouncing that word, turning her eyes towards me, methought I read in them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny happier for me then that of <hi>Metellus.</hi> You know well ſuch favorable encour age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſeldom neglected I cauſed <hi>Flora</hi> be followed to learn her dwelling, and on the morrow pretended ſome neceſſary buſineſs to employ her Father in, and made uſe of the Occaſion to ſpeak with her.</p>
            <p>I was at this time a Widower, having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Daughter, and not yet faln in league with <hi>Murcia,</hi> ſo that I looked upon an
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94436:62"/>intrigue with <hi>Flora</hi> to be the moſt pleaſing amuſement of my mind I could find out. Sympathy had prepared me the way, I need but ſpeak to be liſtned to, and I fancy, had I kept ſilence, I had been intreated to break it. Facility generally diſguſts delicated nice Minds, but it produces a contrary effect, when a Lover regards it as a miracle of Love. That of <hi>Flora</hi> had this Character. What <hi>Metellus</hi> had told me of the Vertue of this Maid, what I daily diſcovered of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſhe had gained; and more then all that, ſomewhat of a ſincere preſſing forward of my heart, and fully diſcovering to me that of my Miſtreſs, perſwaded me that all the love in her was new, and that no Star in the World but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, could have had that influence.</p>
            <p>You may judge by what I have told you, of the diſcourſe I had with <hi>Metellus,</hi> he could be no long time without perceiving my good Fortune; he had a mind to be cleared in his ſuſpitions, and <hi>Flora</hi> thinking her Love an Honor, never took the pains to diſguiſe it to my Rival.</p>
            <p>Yes <hi>Metellus, ſaid ſhe,</hi> I love <hi>Pompey,</hi> one main circumſtance would be wanting to my happineſs, if you ſhould not know his;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94436:62"/>and my heart would be an offering unworthy ſo great a Man, ſhould it not be accompanied with a ſacrifice of your deſires.</p>
            <p>This Declaration making <hi>Metellus</hi> obſerve as much Diſdain in it as Ingenuity, tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Jealouſie almoſt to a Fury; I was forced to uſe all my credit and authority to reſcue <hi>Flora</hi>'s family from the effects of his anger, and had he not died about that time, he had poſſibly done by ſtratagem, what he could not do by open force. His death leaving me in a peaceable poſſeſſion of the fair and loving <hi>Flora,</hi> I cannot ſay I ever paſſed more happy time, then the firſt five or ſix Moneths of this intrigue; but there's no happineſs laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here below, and Man would forget the end for which he was born, if the Providence of the Wiſe God did not mix his pleaſures with ſome pain. <hi>Geminius,</hi> the Companion of my Studies, and Comrade of my Travels, and whom next <hi>Flora</hi> I loved more then all the World, became unhappily in love with this fair Maid, I concealed from him none of the ſecrets of my Soul, he knew my Love, and repreſenting to himſelf the diſpair into which I ſhould fall, if I ſhould find my ſelf betrayed by <hi>Flora,</hi> uſed incredible endeavors to ſuppreſs this powerful inclination. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94436:63"/>of the Soul are more dangerous to a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Man, then the moſt Bloody Battles. <hi>Geminius</hi> fell grievouſly ſick, I ſtir'd not from his Bed-ſide, and <hi>Flora</hi> who could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear my ſight no more then I hers, ſpent whole days with me in this ſick Mans Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Our love was violent, and ſcarce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it ſelf before ſuſpected witneſſes, but we conſtrained it not before our beſt Friends.</p>
            <p>I was ſtill ſpeaking kind and feeling things to <hi>Flora,</hi> and ſhe anſwered me in terms every way as touching, our eyes made a continual commerce of eloquent glances, and the moſt indifferent things were advanced to profit by our laborious Paſſion, every thing turning into an occaſion of expreſſing the warmth of our deſires. Judge into what condition we put the paſſionate and diſcreet <hi>Geminius;</hi> he was brought to that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Phyſitians gave him over; and when he felt his death approaching he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me the cauſe of it. The Friendſhip I had for <hi>Geminius,</hi> could not be balanced by any thing, but my love to <hi>Flora,</hi> were I to have parted with my life to ſave my friends, I ſhould have given it without reflexion; but when I underſtood <hi>Flora</hi> was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94436:63"/>I asked time to reſolve; reſolve nothing <hi>Pompey</hi> ſaid the dying <hi>Geminius,</hi> I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not my grief to find a remedy; I am too happy to die for that I love beſt in the World, and though your generoſity would contribute to my recovery, I know it depends not on you, your happineſs is ſo great, it dazles you, and you ſee but a part of it. I am (ſince ſo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny pleaſes) more clear ſighted, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved particulars in the love of <hi>Flora,</hi> that deſtroy the confidence I could have in your friendſhip. Live happy, and let me die miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and give not that increaſe to my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to let them coſt you one ſorrowful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe pronounced by an expiring Man, and one I ſo dearly loved, touched me to the very Soul, I thought I ought to my friends life, at leaſt, a ſeeming willingneſs to contribute to his cure; and preſuming enough on <hi>Flora</hi>'s conſtancy to believe ſhe would preſerve her ſelf wholly to me in deſpite of myſelf, I aſſured <hi>Geminius</hi> that if he could gain her love, I would look on his happineſs without a murmur: I have not faith enough in the fictions of the Poets, to believe this aſſurance reſtored <hi>Geminius</hi> life, but his diſeaſe being come to the Chriſts, certain it
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94436:64"/>is, that from that day we obſerved his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. I reſolved to aſſiſt it by my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and as well to convince him of my ſincerity, as to avoid the reproaches of <hi>Flora,</hi> I went to ſpend ſome time at the Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, whether <hi>Sylla</hi> was retired, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid down the Dictatorſhip.</p>
            <p>I writ every day to <hi>Flora,</hi> Letters full of that Love poſſeſt my Soul. I had not engaged never to love her more, but onely promiſed ſhe ſhould love my friend if ſhe could. Wretch that ſhe was, ſhe could but do it too much; Love is no mighty task to one of that Sex.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Geminius</hi> Painted my ſlight compliance with ſuch lively colours, that at my return to <hi>Rome,</hi> I learned from <hi>Flora</hi>'s own Mouth her infidelity. How, cryed I, can it be true, that you, loved <hi>Pompey</hi> with ſo much fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and ceaſe to love him with ſo much eaſe? Who has told you I have ceas'd to love you, <hi>replied</hi> Flora? Do you give the title of change to that ſacrifice you conſtrained? Is it becauſe I have reſtored you a Friend, whoſe loſs had made you deſperate, that you accuſe me with want of love? Alaſs, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a thouſand thanks for my chearful obedience, 'twas a thouſand tortures to me
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94436:64"/>to yield to it; and I made uſe of all the powers of my kindneſs to reſolve upon, what you reproach for a decay of Paſſion.</p>

               <hi>Flora</hi> ask'd pardon for her error, and ſwore to me, ſhe would ſtop the career of it, and doubtleſs would have done as the ſaid: That deadly grief ſhe expreſſed at our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, hath-fully perſwaded me <hi>Gemini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> deſtroyed me with my own Weapon, and that <hi>Flora</hi> believed ſhe pleaſed me in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying me; but the remembrance of that inconſtancy has given me diſgusts, I could never vanquiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flora</hi> forbore to ſee my Rival any more, ſhe felt a remorſe for her credulity, which almost cost her her life. I loved her a long time after our rupture, and her memory is yet grateful to me; but <hi>Cato,</hi> I was born nice and delicate, and in my mind true love is incompatible of partnerſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Night rather then want of Matter, broke off the converſe of theſe two Iluſtrious</hi> Romans. <hi>I ſhall find out a way

            <head>THE LOVES OF Great Men. D'ANDELOT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Uring the Progreſs to <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi> the King had given leave to the Duke <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> to hunt in the Foreſt of <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> and to kill the Wild Boar. In one of theſe Chaces, the Dutcheſs <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> Natural Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> coming near to the Incloſure they had made, a Wild Boar broke the Toyls, and frighting her
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94436:66"/>Horſe, he ran clear away with her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left-hand, <hi>D'Andelots</hi> Horſe frighted at the ſame accident, followed Madam <hi>D'Aumales;</hi> her Husband was a good way off, with Prince <hi>Patien,</hi> and Madam <hi>L'Admirale de Brion;</hi> two other Ladies who were near the Dutcheſs, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, that weak aſſiſtance being all they could give her, none daring to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their skill in riding at her rate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> who purſued her on full ſpeed. The cry came ſoon to the Duke, who hearing how his Ladies Horſe was frightned, had not been concerned for her, had he not at the ſame time heard that <hi>D'Andelots</hi> with a like fright, took the ſame way with the Dutcheſſes, he rid then with all ſpeed to overtake them. <hi>D'Andelot</hi> who could not guide his Horſe, letting him run where-ever he pleaſed, heard a noiſe beſide him, and ſaw Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> coming up very near him, but in a moment ſhe was paſſed him, and he loſt ſight of her, by reaſon of a ſmall Coppice was before him, which the way dividing in two, he was forced to enter, and there ſaw Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> faln. That ſight made him ſtrive hard again to ſtop his Horſe, but ſince he could
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94436:66"/>not, he threw himſelf down to take care of her, whom he feared was hurt; ſhe was almoſt ſtunded, and in that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſcovered ſome part of her fair body. There is ſcarce that Love and Conſtancy in the World, can reſiſt againſt ſo many Beauties, and though poſſibly this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes ſight, changed not utterly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>D'Andelots</hi> love, yet ſo pleaſing an adventure made him at leaſt very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but care of the Dutcheſs made him ſoon forego the pleaſure he reaped with his eyes. He was come to her, and had juſt taken her in his arms to lift her up, when the Duke and Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> arrived; yet he gave not over his offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous employ, and the asking her, whether ſhe was hurt. The Dutcheſs thought her ſelf alone with him, and was reaching her lips to his, but he turned his head the other way; a refuſal ſhe would have looked upon, as a rude injury to her Love and Beauty, had not ſhe ſooner perceived what was the cauſe of a Modeſty Men are ſeldom guilty of. But what a ſight was this for a jealous Husband, who was both ſuſpicious of his Wives humor, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Gallants worth; nor in reaſon had Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> leſs cauſe of grief,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94436:67"/>ſuffice it both felt what was hard to be expreſſed even by themſelves; nor were Madam <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> nor <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their ſhare of jealouſie and trouble; and whilſt they could not utter what they thought, their thoughts were the more oppreſſive.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> having a little hurt on her hand and knee, was in her Coach carried back to <hi>Fountainbleau;</hi> but her hurts being ſlight, the Men waited not on her, but returned to the ſport, and took their Darts to aſſail the Wild Boars. <hi>D'Andelots</hi> Horſe being wounded by one of the largeſt, he was forced to alight, and aſſail him on foot. The Duke <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> had a care of him, though he was both his Wives Gallant, and the Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Rival that rob'd him of Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> Heart, and coming up to the Boar, lanced his Dart at the ſame time that <hi>D'Andelot</hi> plunged his in the Boars ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, his throw was unlucky, wounding <hi>D'Andelot</hi> in the hand, as it paſſed into the Boars Flanck, who immediately fell. This unhappy accident much added to the Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi>'s trouble, though chance and misfortune contributed more to <hi>D'Andelots</hi> wound then he, which yet
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94436:67"/>was not ſo great, but he returned on horsback to <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marſhal <hi>de Montmorency,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was his near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Brother-in-law, to the Duke <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> having heard what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at this Chaſe, came to viſit the Dutcheſs and <hi>D'Andelot.</hi> The Marſhal was a mighty amorous Gallant Perſon, who always loved more then one; and his inconſtancies were authoriſed by his being one of the handſomeſt Men of his time; he knew there was a Treaty of Love between <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> in which Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> ſeemed to have ſome concern. The pain of his Wounds, being in eight days allayed, he was obliged to comply with the Marſhals preſſing intreaties and yield to his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, who being deſirous to know his ſtory, he thus began it.</p>

               <head>His ſtory of the Loves of the Lady Admirale <hi>De Brion</hi> and <hi>D'Andelot.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Siege of <hi>Orleans</hi> having waſted much time, and forces of the Kings Army, Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> endeavored a Peace: The Conference of the <hi>Iſle aux Boeufs</hi> being ended, leave was as you know granted to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who together with the <hi>Constable,</hi> had been taken at <hi>Dreux,</hi> to come to <hi>Orleans</hi> with the more freedom to confer with the friends of their party. The Princeſs of <hi>Conde</hi> came likewiſe thither from S. <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and brought with her the Admiral <hi>de Brion.</hi> War had diverted my mind from Love, and if I may ſay it without vanity, I had no leiſure to entertain any thoughts of that Paſſion; but now he took his time, and ſurpriſed me at <hi>Orleans</hi> at the ſight of Madam <hi>de Brion.</hi> I ſpent there one part of the day in confulting with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Saint Cire,</hi> about the beſt ways of preſerving the power of our party, and in the evening failed not to wait on the Princeſs, where I enjoyed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:94436:68"/>the pleaſure of an indifferent and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous converſe, which was ſomewhat hard to advance; but which I begun to deſire might become more ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> had not yet perceived in me what I deſired ſhe ſhould, her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned and indifferent carriage made me fearful of ſucceſs, but love emboldned me. It may be, I put too much truſt in him; but when we find we muſt love, and are ſure to love well, what is it we are not inclined to hope from ſo fair a Paſſion.</p>
               <p>I was one day with her, when an <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Painter brought ſome Pictures to ſell; he hapned to be in the City when the Siege was laid to it, and was forced to ſtay there till it was drawn off, having heard of the arrival of the Prince and Princeſs; he had ſhowed them ſome Picture which they had bought, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> loved them, he brought what he had left to her Lodgings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Painter</hi> ſpoke <hi>French</hi> ſo ill, he could ſcarce be underſtood. I earneſtly viewed one of his Pictures, which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion</hi> obſerving, and finding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94436:69"/>in it both curious and pleaſant, askt me if I knew the ſtory.</p>
               <p>The ingenious Fable you there ſee diſcribed Madam, ſaid I, is taken out of the Works of the famous <hi>Taſſo. Armida</hi> the Enchantreſs having received many cruel affronts from <hi>Rinaldo</hi> before ſhe knew him, was reſolved on revenge; ſhe advances towards the Chriſtian Camp, diſcovers, approaches, and in ſhort, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it under pretence of craving aid from <hi>Godfrey</hi> the General. <hi>Rinaldo,</hi> who till then, had never thought of love, could not reſtrain his eyes from wandring on hers, his heart ſob'd and was troubled, and began to feel for <hi>Armida,</hi> what it had never felt before. How glad was he when ſhe made choice of him in the occaſion ſhe pretended to have to make uſe of valor? Though <hi>Armida</hi> was learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Magick Sciences, and knew well the vertues and power of all Simples, Characters, and Words; yet her greateſt charm and ſtrongeſt enchantment lay in her Beauty; which <hi>Taſſo</hi> tells us, was ſo commanding, that the whole Camp would have followed her. But <hi>Rinaldo</hi> gains the preference, becauſe ſhe onely asked for him. <hi>Armida</hi> having now got
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94436:69"/>her enemy into her hands, buries her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in looking on him: Love baniſht indignation, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> was too brave and too much inamored to prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to ſo kind and fair a perſon. <hi>Armida</hi> builds an inchanted Palace, and in the Gardens of that Palace which you there ſee repreſented, theſe two lovers forgot every thing elſe to enjoy all the pleaſures of love. Take notice, Madam, of that young Lady, ſeated on the Banks of a Fountain, proceeded I, ſhowing her by her eyes, by her air, by her features, you cannot judge her other then <hi>Armida;</hi> and that lovely handſome Man, cannot be other then <hi>Rinaldo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Painter, who doubtleſs ſought in the whole ſtory, ſome what might appear moſt pleaſing, could find nothing more proper then this to repreſent, which he has done with ſo much art, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to behold <hi>Armida</hi> ſo full of love and beauty, and <hi>Rinaldo</hi> ſo handſome and ſo paſſionate without deſiring to be in love.</p>
               <p>I obſerved the Admiral was pleaſed with hearkning to me, and it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented me to ſee her buy the Picture. The Princeſs juſt in the nick came to take her
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94436:70"/>out to walk, and I'll promiſe you this was the firſt time ever her ſight had griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; the Picture had given me the opportunity to enter on ſome diſcourſe of my love, which I had determined not to loſe, but now was conſtrained.</p>
               <p>Going thence I met with <hi>Saint Cire,</hi> who told me the Prince would ſpeak with me. I haſtned to him, but found 'twas no ſtate affair he had to communicate; you know him, and know he is very incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to love, and hard to forego it, once entred into. Mademoiſelle <hi>de Bourlemont</hi> whom you have ſeen near the Princeſs, had ſmitten him ere he was aware, the letting her know it, was a thing wherein the Prince was obliged to obſerve much Caution: Yet he had ſo well ordered the affair that he had ſpoke, and the Lady had not believed it dangerous to hearken to him; nay more, ſhe appeared jealous, as if ſhe could have wiſhed the Princes love no ſtraggler.</p>
               <p>This was in ſhort what he had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, having drawn me to a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that none elſe might hear, he told me he had choſen me for his confident, and encouraging me thereby to a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I declared to him my concern for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94436:70"/>Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> he promiſed me, and I aſſured him of a reciprocal aſſiſtance in his love.</p>
               <p>Hereupon we went into the walks to wait on the Princeſs and the Admiral, who as ſoon as we came up to her, 'tis tedious being here ſaid ſhe to me, cannot you invent ſome pleaſing divertiſement to drive away melancholly. I have it at hand Madam, ſaid I, what can be more pleaſant then to talk of love, you have nothing here to divert it, and I find my heart inclineable to treat of it with none but you. Where did you learn to talk thus, ſaid ſhe, ſmiling; who has taught you to look ſo on me, Madam, replied I, in a jovial manner, but was much afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I could ſay no more, for <hi>Bourlemont</hi> and another of the Princeſs Women coming up to us, interrupted us, and I could not find a minutes opportunity all that Evening to continue what I had begun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bourlemont</hi> who took notice with what delight I obſerved Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> ſoftly in my ear, asked me, if I were in love; as much as the Prince is with you, replied I, ſo that the reſt might not hear: She would needs know what I meant by that,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94436:71"/>and I explained it to her, ſhe bluſht, and ſeem'd coy, as if ſhe deſired not his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but I judged the contrary, and told my obſervations to the Prince, who requited them with giving me ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of his Negotiations with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, that I began to believe my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts not impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> came to <hi>Orleans</hi> to treat on the Kings behalf, as you very well know about the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome places, which the Prince could hardly conſent to. The Dutcheſs was with him, whoſe arrival, turned the whole Town into pleaſure and divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and many days were ſpent in Feaſts and Balls.</p>
               <p>That day the Dutcheſs coming was firſt known, I happened to be with Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> we were at firſt talking of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand indifferent things; but in the end, I changed the diſcourſe, endeavoring to improve thoſe few minutes my good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gave me. The Admiral anſwered very wittily to all I ſaid of my Paſſion; but I ſought a return of love, and was little ſatisfied with thoſe reperties. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the melancholly and ſeriouſneſs, with which I diſcourſed, cauſed ſome joy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94436:71"/>in her, and I loved her too well to rob her of that pleaſure. I gueſſed, Madam, ſaid I, that love would rejoyce you, and you would not believe me; but if you would now frankly declare your thoughts, I am ſure they muſt agree with mine.</p>
               <p>I'll ſwear your company does divertiſe me, replied ſhe, and I cannot but laugh at your deſign of Courtſhip; but you muſt underſtand I have a kind of ſtubborn heart, that neither knows love, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to know it: I'll awaken that deſire in it, Madam, replied I, and will aſſure you, on Loyes behalf, he takes it very ill you ſhould treat me ſo cruelly. Take heed of quarrelling with him, he is a powerful enemy, who infallibly revenges himſelf on his deſpiſers. To let you ſee I don't fear him, replied ſhe, I'll wager with you, he never overcomes me: Do not lay any wagers, anſwered I, for you will be ſure to loſe.</p>
               <p>She would not take my advice, and we concluded to agree on the wager, when <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> came in, and was choſen judge, if any difference happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, ſhe is a Kinſwoman of hers whom you have often ſeen with her, and who had a great power over her. We
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94436:72"/>had much ado to agree what our wager ſhould be, I would have had hers to have been ſome favors, but that was not her deſign; yet having repreſented to her, that ſhe run no hazard, being as ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, ſhe was ſure to win, ſhe conſented in the end, to engage to admit my utmoſt ſervice, and I conſented never to ſee her more, and to quit the Princes party, if I loſt. What will not men in love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? I gave her my word, and ſhe aſſured me hers; two Moneths was the time allowed for tryal, at the end of which, <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> was to give judgment which had won: I took my leave of her, with telling her, that I was reſolved to neglect nothing to gain her; ſhe anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe already accounted me of the Kings party, and I you Madam, ſaid I, of loves.</p>
               <p>I came thence well ſatisfied with what I had ſaid, and what I had done, and my joy made the Prince ſuſpect me more happy then he. I endeavored to perſwade him the contrary, who eaſily believed me, but I told him nothing of the wager. You cannot imagine, ſaid he to me, how lovely <hi>Bourlemont</hi> appears to me, I fancy I ſhall ever love her. All ſay ſo, ſaid I, when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94436:72"/>they begin to be in love; and there is a pretty delight in ſaying and thinking our love ſhall never end; but afterwards when its fervency begins decay, and the kindneſs decreaſes without knowing a reaſon for it. Believe me, we return to our ſelves, and to our wonted tempers and yours, being to be inconſtant; ſo ſoon as you are ſatisfied, we ſhall hear no more from you, that Madam <hi>Bourlemont</hi> is fair, or that you ſhall love for ever. Its very true, anſwered he, I love change, and finding it delightful, cannot think of confining my ſelf. Believe me, <hi>D'Andelot</hi> there are pleaſures in inconſtancy, and 'tis a mighty ſatisfaction, to make love in a great many places at once, and to find anſwers ſuitable to our deſires.</p>
               <p>I left the Prince in this opinion, in which I could not reſolve to imitate him.</p>
               <p>That Evening the Duke and Dutcheſs <hi>D'Aumale</hi> arrived, there was a Ball at the Princes, where I received, without thinking of it, ſome favorable glances from Madam <hi>D'Aumale.</hi> I deſired not hers, but Madam <hi>de Brions,</hi> whom the Duke entertained, and me thought I obſerved in his addreſſes to her, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94436:73"/>of the courtſhip of a Man in love. He was a Rival might well be feared, the Admiral hearkned to him, and my jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie made me diſcover a thouſand things diſtracted me. The Dutcheſs came to take me out to dance, and I left her not all that Evening. Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved what I did, I perceived it, but I forbore not diſcourſing with the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs.</p>
               <p>On the morrow the Duke came to viſit the Admiral, I happened to be there, and having obſerved her more nearly then at the Ball, began to ſuſpect her already in a condition to make me loſe my wager, the loſs was conſiderable, and many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons obliged me to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Mean time the Prince proſecuted his love with <hi>Bourlemont,</hi> and his endeavors were not ſucceſsleſs, he had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to know ſhe did not hate him; he let me know his happineſs, and not truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any other the ſecret of his Paſſion, gave me a Letter for her, but I loſt it, and it unhappily fell into Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> hands, who not knowing my Character, thought after having read the following Lines I had deſerted her for the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:94436:73"/>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You unjuſtly accuſe me with loving the Admiral, have a better opinion of your own Beauty, and my Faith, and think not I can love by halves. 'Tis poſſible I may have given occaſion for your ſuſpitions by thoſe enterviews you have ſeen between us; but believe me, they were not all on the ſcore of love, and when their cauſes ſhall be known, you will repent you: Injuſtice and I ſhall have the ſatisfaction not to have any cauſe to reproach you.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Though at the ſight of this, ſhe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a joy and content, I found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe had much ado to reſtrain her grief and anguiſh.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs loved her very well, and that ſhe might have the more of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſhe left her Lodgings, and went to ſojourn at Madam <hi>D'Aumales,</hi> during her ſtay at <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt night ſhe went to lie there, there happened a tumult in the City. One of the Duke <hi>D'Aumales</hi> ſervants quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a Citizen, who was wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed for the party, and called him Rebel: He could not endure that injury, and the ſervant was very ſcurvily treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94436:74"/>other ſervants came in to his aid, and the Neighbors to the Citizens. The quarrel grew general, and the Citizens in great numbers preſſed even to the Dukes Gates, and entered them, and their animoſity made it be feared they would force in that tumultuous manner through all the Lodgings. The Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> being with the Prince, had news of the commotion, and having told it me, I made haſte and came juſt at the inſtant they had paſt the Court, and were breaking open the Dutcheſs Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I appeaſed the multitude, and at my name the door was opened, and I took the Dutcheſs, and conveyed her out by a convenient poſtern.</p>
               <p>I knew not that the Admiral had that night changed Lodings, nor did the Dutcheſs tell me ſo, till I had put her in a place of ſecurity. <hi>Saint Cire,</hi> whom I had made ſtay at the Dukes Lodgings to compleat the appeaſing of the tumult, took care of the Admiral, and I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately to ſee if I were obeyed, was ſurpriſed to ſee Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out with <hi>Saint Cire,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting her to the Princeſſes, I excuſed my ſelf, not knowing her to have been
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94436:74"/>at the Dutcheſſes, ſhe received my excuſe very coldly, yet upbraided me not, but civilly diſpenced with my attending her.</p>
               <p>The Prince underſtanding from <hi>Bourle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> I had not given her his Letter, asked me, what I had done with it; I told him how I had loſt it, and ſought in vain for it, in all places where I had been. <hi>Bourlemont</hi> was mighty angry at my neglect, fearing his privacies with the Prince might take air by it; but I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied her by telling her, none could ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to whom it was writ, being without ſuperſcription; and the hand was ſo well counterfeited, 'twould rather be taken for mine, then the Princes.</p>
               <p>All which was but too true, and that reſemblance but too much juſtified, when the <hi>Admirale</hi> ſaw in the Dutcheſs hands Verſes, ſhe had prayed me to give her, and which I had writ.</p>
               <p>For my part, I who ſuſpected not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>De Brions</hi> thoughts, employed all my cares to incline her affection: The Duke managed the ſame deſign, and I often feared with better ſucceſs then my ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94436:75"/>
               <p>Though the Dutcheſs was ſtill extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favourable to me, yet I conſtrained my ſelf not to perceive what ſhe would have me ſee; how eaſie had been my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage unto her Heart, had I had a deſign to enter it. All Prince <hi>Portiau</hi>'s Merit had vaniſhed for me, and I plainly ſaw it muſt be my fault if I were not beloved by one of the faireſt Perſons of the world, but I could not conſent to it, whilſt my Love to the <hi>Admirale</hi> withſtood it, and I choſe rather to be conſtant and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with her, then dearly beloved elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>My mind told me, theſe thoughts ought to hope for ſome reward, if they were but known, but there was nothing beheld in me but Treaſon and Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that was a ſtrange kind of way to gain Love from any Perſon.</p>
               <p>They were playing one night at the Princeſſes, the <hi>Admirale</hi> was onely look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and I thought it a convenient time to ſpeak to her, and having drawn her out of the hearing of the company, I begin to apprehend, ſaid I, that you will not love me, and that I ſhall loſe my wager, but Madam, is not the Duke <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> the cauſer? that reproach drew on
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94436:75"/>hers, and ſhe appeared to me full of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and jealouſie, and yet in the mixture I could diſcern ſome Love; you will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that loſs with Madam <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> ſaid ſhe, and her Beauty will make good all you can loſe by me, Ah Madam, 'tis onely your heart I am ambitious of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I, and though I cannot obtain it with all my ſufferings, I will never give you the pleaſure to call me unfaithful. You have fully done it already, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe with a diſdainful ſmile, but you deſerve not I ſhould complain of you; that would be a mark of eſteem, and I have onely ſcorn for you: I beſought her to no purpoſe, to explain why ſhe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me thus. She returned to ſee them play, and I withdrew, ſatisfied to know a part of her thoughts, but terribly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted at the reproach ſhe made me.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> having finiſhed his Treaty with the Prince, returned to Court. The Dutcheſs at departure, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſad and melancholly, attributed it to her ſelf, and obliged her thoughts with an opinion I was concerned for her. The <hi>Admirale</hi> thought as ſhe did, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time that ſhe ſtaied at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to ſhun my company and ſcorn me.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:94436:76"/>
               <p>The Conſtable being brought back to the City, the Prince and Princeſs went thence together with Madam <hi>de Brion.</hi> She would not have ſeen me, but I would wait on her on the way; I expected at leaſt ſome indifferent regards, but I had not ſo much as that ſmall content, and believed my ſelf unhappy. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> perceiving my grief, made me aſſign to hope, and I anſwered her by other ſigns.</p>
               <p>My Brother the Admiral was come to <hi>Orleans</hi> one day before the Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he was diſſatisfied with the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would have had it broke, but the Prince could not conſent.</p>
               <p>Soon after, Peace being concluded, I heard that Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> was at one of her Lord ſhips, within two Leagues of my Houſe at <hi>Tanley;</hi> having no buſineſs of conſequence at Court, I went down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of building a Lodge after the Italian mode, and to that end ſome days before me, ſent down and Architect had undertook it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I had reached <hi>Tanlay,</hi> all my thoughts were employed how to ſee the <hi>Admirale;</hi> I knew her fair, and lov'd her, and would purchaſe her love at what rate ſoever. I acquainted <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94436:76"/>Letter of my deſign to ſee Madam <hi>de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſhe returned me anſwer, 'twas not yet time, and that the <hi>Admirale</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry at me, but mentioned not the occaſion; but withal told me, that ſhe was going for eight days to viſit an Aunt of hers; whither, if I would take the pains to come, I might know the cauſe of all.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as I could learn <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> was come to her Aunts, I went to her Houſe, which was but three Leagues diſtant from mine. I have already told you, <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> was a kinſwoman of Madam <hi>de Brions,</hi> and that ſhe entruſted her with all her ſecrets, yet certain it is, the <hi>Admirale</hi> knew not that I had writ to her, or that ſhe had anſwered me, or appointed me to ſee her.</p>
               <p>She made me a very civil and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reception, and at her ſight I was more rejoyced then I had been ſince the abſence of Madam <hi>de Brion;</hi> ſhe told me from whence the anger proceeded, and that its original was from the ſuſpitions ſhe had, I was in love with Madam <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> which were confirmed by a Letter ſhe accuſed me to have writ to her; 'twas not hard to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify my ſelf on the whole to <hi>Fontpertuis:</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:94436:77"/>did it, ſhe believed me, and aſſured me I was not hated.</p>
               <p>The aſſurance made me hope I muſt be beloved; ſhe was to be judge, the time drew nigh that our wager was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; I truſted neither ſo much to my love, nor the kindneſs the <hi>Admirale</hi> might conceive for me, as to neglect the care of making my judge favourable: there lay all my thoughts, after having taken leave of <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> and his Aunt.</p>
               <p>My Houſhold affairs, Unſeaſonable viſits, and Letters from the Prince and <hi>Admirale,</hi> which I was obliged to anſwer, kept me two days from ſeeing <hi>Fontpertuis.</hi> You may have obſerved ſhe is taking e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, has Wit and pleaſant Converſe, and I ſtood in need of her Credit. As ſoon as I came ſhe complained of my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in not ſeeing her all that time; her manner of looking and talking with me made me ſuſpect her heart was ſmitten: I reſolved to make Tryal, and found my ſelf not deceived, ſhe was indeed in love, I told her what I thought, ſhe confeſſed it, bluſhing, and caſting down her Eyes. In this conjuncture, I forgot the Love and Faith I owed the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and greedily
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94436:77"/>ſnatching the opportunity offered, had the pleaſure to ſeduce my Judge.</p>
               <p>In four other viſits I paid her, I had the like entertainment; I confirmed her good intentions towards me, and doubted not of her giving ſentence on my ſide, if the <hi>Admirale</hi> would be determined by her judgement; yet ſometimes I feared leſt <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had too much love, which might forbid her ſuffering me to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and engage her for the Duke <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> who ſince his departure from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> had put all thoſe things in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, carried any likelihood of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his deſires; but ſhe ſatisfied me with ſo much ſweetneſs and kindneſs, that I had no farther trouble then the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hour of judgement.</p>
               <p>She took leave of her Aunt, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> counſelling me to come thither, without asking her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and I was too much in love to neglect her counſel; I followed her next morning, and without telling the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who I was, asked for <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> who was brought to me; ſhe told me the <hi>Admirale</hi> was in an Arbor in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; I requeſted her to ſhew me the place, ſhe was my guide, and ſhewing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94436:78"/>me the Arbor, left me within ſome few ſteps of it.</p>
               <p>I preſently went into the Arbor, and there beheld Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> aſleep on a Bed of <hi>Sods.</hi> Had I till then been unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, this ſight would have made me love: The ſweet compoſure and loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Neck, which all appeared, ſtrangely moved and tickled me, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant extaſie ſpread it ſelf through my whole body, and I was wrapt up into tranſports and deſires that appeared to me almoſt like a third Heaven, to which I found all my inclinations ſo ready to bend, 'twas onely one way poſſible for me to find a happineſs beyond it, for ſtill I but lookt and durſt do no more, till love made me a little bolder; and what had I not done if ſhe had not waked? ſhe was ſurprized to ſee me, and ſee her ſelf alone with me. How <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> ſaid ſhe, you that are ſo obliged to me, how can you forget that I requeſted you no more to ſee me. Alas Madam, ſaid I, who would not forget it when Love Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it? At this ſhe roſe up, and <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> coming in, I continued talking after that rate, not doubting but my diſcourſe was more acceptable, then it would have been perſwaded.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:94436:78"/>
               <p>You ſee Madam, ſaid I, an unhappy Man, who comes onely to know, by what juſtice you have condemned him to ſuch ſufferings? do you ſet no value on his Love and Faith, and muſt he hope nothing from his perſeverance? Pardon me Madam, if I call you ingrateful; you deſerve that Title, added I ſighing, though once I thought I ſhould never have cauſe to call you ſo. Your perfidiouſneſs, replyed ſhe, has ſmothered all I found lovely in you, I have obſerved your crime at large, but you have given me ſo little leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern your paſſion, that I have happily ſuppreſſed the Commencements of mine. Ah Madam, ſaid I, interrupting her, that victory you will gain over your ſelf, will coſt me dear; 'tis hard for me to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Treaſon, by what I love more then all the world, and judge but how it muſt afflict me, I cannot make you ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Love deſerves any thing! At this I asked her what was my crime, ſhe fairly told me, and 'twas as eaſie for me to juſtifie my ſelf by ſhowing many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letters in the ſame Character which the Prince had writ to me; ſhe began to liſten, and in ſhort, was ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I overthrew all the unjuſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94436:79"/>ſuſpitions ſhe had conceived againſt me; our diſcourſe ended in her gracing with an apparant joy, the finding me loving and conſtant, and I ſtudied to ſix her imaginations upon the conſent I received from her ſight and goodneſs, and left her not till I bore off all that Hope could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had indeed great care to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me, and ſeconded earneſtly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of my innocency. I ſaw very well what thanks ſhe expected, and ſhe deſerved them, but poor ſoul, was cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of time and opportunity.</p>
               <p>Soon after my return to <hi>Tanlay,</hi> the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Aumale</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the ſight of my Rival troubled me as much as the Dutcheſſes; I underſtood preſently, that the Duke could not paſs by without ſeeing the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and thoſe deſires made him ſubmit to perſwade the Dutcheſs to paſs by <hi>Taulay,</hi> which found in her a readier compliance, out of hopes her Beauty and addreſs might at laſt van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the indifference I had ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her: They ſtayed two days at my houſe, where I entertained them with all the divertiſements a Countrey Houſe could afford in the beſt ſeaſon of the year;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94436:79"/>ſince 'twas impoſſible for me to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with the Dutcheſs: ſhe took her time when the Duke was otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; I found in her diſcourſe ſo much love would have raviſhed me, had it come from the <hi>Admirale;</hi> what would not I have given to have heard her ſay halfe thoſe kind things the Dutcheſs did? You are penſive <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, jogging me by the Arm, and take no care to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me: I turned my ſelf towards her, ſighing, without thinking of it; what would you have me anſwer Madam, ſaid I? recollecting my ſelf, you cannot but think as well as I, how little I deſerve the reſpect you give me: I could not have thought, replied ſhe, there was a Man in the world ſo cruel, or who had ſo great a value of himſelf as to ſlight the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of one of my birth, but you have made me believe there are ſuch, and I find it ſo great a torment, as nothing can counterpoyſe, unleſs you change your thoughts. Ah Madam, cryed I, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting her, why cannot I love you; or why may not I lay open to you the ſecrets of a heart, I cannot give you; for if I ſhould divide it, 'twould give you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual cauſe of complaint, and me no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94436:80"/>No, no, ſaid ſhe, I will have no divided heart, and had much rather it ſhould be all Madam <hi>de Brion</hi>'s, then I have but a part.</p>
               <p>One of the <hi>Admirales</hi> Gentlemen came to interrupt us, his meſſage was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment the Dutcheſs on her arrival, and to deſire her to come and ſpend ſome few days in her Houſe; ſhe was ſomewhat at a ſtand what to anſwer, when the Duke who came up to us, took the word out of her mouth, and promiſed on the morrow to come wait upon her; I perceived her diſcontent at the Dukes haſte to leave <hi>Tanlay,</hi> but now ſhe muſt ſubmit, and I had too much intereſt to accompany her, to omit it.</p>
               <p>The Duke and Dutcheſs had Lodgings appointed them, looking out upon a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race of Orange Trees (as moſt of the reſt do) the Dutcheſs lay in one Chamber, and the Duke in another by the ſide of it.</p>
               <p>At Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> we received the news of the preparations made to beſiege <hi>Havre de grace,</hi> the Engliſh Forces were much feared, the Prince was in League with them, during the War, and it was feared upon a breach, they would ſend
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94436:80"/>him conſiderable relief. Orders being brought to me for the march of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, I diſpatched them to all places whither they were to be diſtributed, and I made ready my Equipage, to be in eight days at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> where the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous was appointed.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> was much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſight of Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> and I was as much pleaſed to know I was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Dutcheſs eaſily ſpied out my joy, and all I could do to conceal my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, was of no proof againſt her jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, which formed things bigger then they were.</p>
               <p>The two moneths the <hi>Admirale</hi> and I had taken for the deciſion of our wager were now expired within four days; I put her in mind of it, ſhe only bluſht, and anſwered nothing, but her ſilence was a Million, my Love underſtood it very well. I was diligent to ſecure my Judges favour by that complaiſance a faithful Lover ſhould onely give to the Perſon he loved; but Intereſt changes maximes of Love and that obliged me to treat thus with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> to whom my kindneſs was but policy.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:94436:81"/>
               <p>There were ſent from <hi>Paris</hi> to Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> two <hi>China</hi> Gowns excellently ſtained with little Antick Figures, which appeared the more admirable, becauſe <hi>Europe</hi> had ſeen ſo few of them. She gave the fineſt to Madam <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Admirale,</hi> wore hers, put it on the ſame day. That Evening, as we were all in the Garden, and that walking in the Serene, gave us a delight, the heats of the day had robbed us of. I coming near to <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> be ſure to meet me, ſaid ſhe, on the <hi>Orange Terrace,</hi> I have ſomewhat to ſay to you in behalf of— I made her a ſign to ſpeak lower, Madam <hi>d'Aumale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by us.</p>
               <p>The Duke, Amorous, Zealous, and withal ill treated, talked of love with the <hi>Admirale.</hi> Will you be always cruel Madam, ſaid he, and never pitty what I ſuffer; you will find much more ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that amorous converſation, I ſo ſincerely propoſe then in that indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hinders, and by its niceneſs, obſtructs the injoyments of thoſe pleaſures love would confer, but Madam <hi>d'Andelot</hi> loves you, and can you be ſo inſenſible as you appear? Theſe words ſmote her but after having ſtood mute a while, Should I
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94436:81"/>permit you, ſaid ſhe, to ſearch my heart, you would find little there, conributing to your deſires; your love ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Dutcheſs onely, ſhe is one of the moſt charming perſons of the World, and I will never be upbraided to have bred a diſunion between you.</p>
               <p>He would have replied, but the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> unwilling to hear any more, called Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> who was ſtill talking as faſt of love to me, as I was aſſuring her, that if ſhe knew me well, ſhe would ſoon be convinced I did not deſerve her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> cloſing continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> it was impoſſible for me to have any talk with her; but my eyes ſpoke what my tongue could not, and hers anſwered me, ſo that I enjoyed not onely the content to know I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but that my ſufferings were ſhared in.</p>
               <p>The Haut Boys and Flutes I had brought playing us ſome tunes, we ſtayed till night being pretty well ſpent, Supper was brought into a Pleaſure-Houſe in the Garden, and having afterwards taken ſome few turns about the Alleys, all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to reſt, but I to expect the good
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94436:82"/>hour <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had aſſigned me. All the obliging ſigns and glances Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> had given me, made me believe ſhe would haſten my felicity, and that <hi>Fonpertuis</hi> had order to be the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer.</p>
               <p>I came therefore to the appointed Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, the night was as cloudy as lovers would deſire. I gingerly marched on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Admirales</hi> Lodgings, and as well as night would give me leave; methought I perceived a Woman come out, I advanced, and ſhe came towards me. I thought I knew her by her <hi>China</hi> Gown, and her ſtature, but methought much more by her deſires and mine, that were ſo preſſing, they made her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand I would ſpeak with her, and ſhe had the goodneſs to hear them at the Foot of an <hi>Organge</hi> Tree adjoyning to an Arbor.</p>
               <p>On a ſudden I heard a noiſe on the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, and ſaw the Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> paſſing ſwiftly by, we imprudently ſtaid in the place where we were, and he perceived us, and ſighing, withdrew. I was half diſtracted at this adventure, but much more when I diſcerned I was not with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion,</hi> but the Dutcheſs. I perceive
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94436:82"/>by your ſurpriſe, ſaid ſhe, you thought your ſelf happier then you are.</p>
               <p>At that a door opened, and out came <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> but I had ſaid ſo much to the Dutcheſs I had not a word to ſay to her, who ſtrangely reproached me for that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhe did not expect.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs withdrew by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, over which ſhe came, and retired into her Chamber, much confuſed to think on what might happen on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, not knowing what to reſolve, nor how to bear the reproaches ſhe expected from the Duke.</p>
               <p>He had other thoughts then to ſuſpect it was ſhe that I entertained ſo kindly on the Terrace, he was as well as I deceived by the likeneſs of the Gowns, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it was Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> with his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. It was that ſight troubled him, and he roſe as ſoon as it was day, impatiently waiting the <hi>Admirales</hi> riſing, ſhe ſtirred not till it was late, and he attributed her ſleeping ſo long, to her laſt nights watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Terrace, which ranged all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Lodgings; and therefore it was an eaſie matter for the Duke, the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and me, to meet.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:94436:83"/>
               <p>The Dutcheſs had heard what <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> ſaid to me in the Garden, and ſtudied to inhanſe all the ſweetneſs of that rendezvous, and had her deſire. The Duke thinking the Dutcheſs aſleep, ſoftly paſſed her Chamber, and having obſerved ſome kind glances, and perhaps more imprudent ſigns paſs between the <hi>Admirale</hi> and me, which beſpake a great Union of Heart, his jealouſie urged him to ſpy, whether I went not into Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> Chamber, who having watched longer then I thought, went to Bed onely at break of day, and roſe not till an hour before Dinner.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe was up, ſhe asked for me, and hearing I was with the Dutcheſs, was coming directly to her Chamber, when the Duke coming out, deſired a moments audience. She was irreſolute at firſt, but at laſt conſented. You are onely ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me Madam, ſaid he, and I muſt be the unhappy witneſs of an action of love repreſented laſt night on the Terrace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>D'Andelot</hi> and you. Though Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> was not diſpoſed to mirth, what the Duke ſaid ſeemed to her ſo full of raillery, ſhe could not forbear laughing; that action madded him, and he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94436:83"/>have heard her rave and be angry, then have beheld ſo injurious a ſcorn. He could not apprehend the meaning of it, and I believe had he known it, would have excuſed himſelf from acquainting the <hi>Admirale</hi> with what had hapned.</p>
               <p>But her laughter being all the anſwer, the Duke could with all his complaints and reproaches obtain, ſhe comes into the Dutcheſs Chamber, who asks her the cauſe of her mirth; but Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> could not truly tell it her. She found her intelligence falſe, as to my being there, for I was before gone out into the Garden, where I began to muſe of the cruel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences might ariſe from that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to my love, if the <hi>Admirale</hi> knew it. Alaſs, ſhe but too well knew all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, for having heard a noiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Terrace, ſhe had ſtept into her Cloſet, whence ſhe ſaw the Dutcheſs, and ſoon after knew me, and ſaw my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity at large. Till no longer able to endure the ſight, ſhe withdrew to her Bed, but the remembrance of what ſhe had ſeen, ſo afflicted her, ſhe could not ſleep a wink, ſuch ſtrange thoughts it poſſeſſed her with.</p>
               <p>One came in the morning to tell me,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94436:84"/>the Duke deſired me to come to his Chamber, but it was the Dutcheſs would ſpeak with me. I imagined it was her love had formed this deceit, and would have retired, but ſhe withheld me. Had I believed, ſaid ſhe, to me, that the gift I have made you of my heart, would have onely been the parent of ſuch an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I ſhould have ſtruggled hard ere I had given way to it; what has love done to you, to make you ſo little ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his favors received from me? Have you ſo ſoon forgot how kind and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing they were? Muſt I firſt ſend for you? Or ſhould you have firſt begged my ſight, unleſs you think me ſo unworthy that I am bound always to be the wooer? Though you love the <hi>Admirale,</hi> you ſtill ſeem lovely to me, and you ſhall always find me with the ſame amorous intentions, you thought ſo happily to find upon the Terrace. The Dutcheſs deſires were very violent as you may perceive, but I willing to preſerve all mine for Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> whoſe wager I would gladly win, was content with the reſervedneſs, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to which they were reſtrained, whilſt ſolicited by a perſon ſo beautiful and fair. She was forced to break off her
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94436:84"/>complaints againſt my unconcernment, by the Dukes entrance, who found us alone. And I began as well as the Dutcheſs to fear ſome eruel effects of his reſentments for the offence we had committed; but he not knowing it, our fears were ſoon blown over.</p>
               <p>I met <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> in the Garden, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one of Madam <hi>D'Aumales</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I perceived ſhe was angry with me. I knew well that I deſerved not to be loved by Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> I had neither given ſufficient teſtimonies of love, nor done all I ought to arrive at ſuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but all my hopes lay in the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and kindneſs of my Judge, who now avoided my ſight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Admirale</hi> who was filled with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and diſdain, looked now no more on me with the accuſtomed ſweetneſs; that change made me ſenſible ſhe knew all paſſed upon the Terrace, and I was fully convinced of it, when from on one of her Gentlewomen I received this Letter.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I <hi>Write to the moſt ungrateful Man living. Examine the perfidiouſneſs of your heart, and you will ſoon find, it is to you this Letter is addreſſed. How happy had mine been, had
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94436:85"/>it never had thoughts for you? But what has it done; you ſhould affront it with ſo much cruelty: That heart which thought onely of you, and was decreed onely for you? But of what uſe are theſe feeble complaints and reproaches? You have affronted me, and it is a ſin to forgive you: Yet could I find the leaſt doubt of your infidelity, my grief would be allayed, and I ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the doleful conſtraint of never more ſeeing that Man I have ſo much loved. But alaſs, I ſaw your diſloyalty, nor could ever Man be more guilty then you. You cannot now ſay you love, nor have any pretence to juſtifie your ſelf; therefore begone immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and flie from the pretence of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Woman, can no longer endure your preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>After having read it, I entreated her that brought it to carry an Anſwer, but ſhe excuſed her ſelf as being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</p>
               <p>All her rage fell not upon me, <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> had her ſhare, ſhe had ſeen her on the Terrace with me, and that place looked ſuſpiciouſly at ſuch a time of night: She took unkindly all that <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis</hi> could alledge to her, believing
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94436:85"/>ſhe had betrayed her, in favor of the Dutcheſs.</p>
               <p>I knew not what to think, nor what to reſolve in this accident, the ſecureſt way had been to ſpeak to the <hi>Admirale,</hi> but ſhe blaſted all opportunities. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being impoſſible without diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her, I choſe rather to be gone, and by that obſervance of her commands, make her ſenſible I ſtill wore her Chains.</p>
               <p>But I did not that till I had ſpoke with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> ſhowed her the Letter the <hi>Admirale</hi> had writ, and given her one in return of it: Which done, I took Horſe for <hi>Tanlay,</hi> where after I had ſtayed two days, I went to the Rendezvous at <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> I lay under great vexations after my departure, though I heard my Letter had driven away moſt part of her ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. At firſt ſhe was unwilling to ſee it, but <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> having opened it, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion</hi> read theſe words in it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I <hi>Am not ſo guilty as you think me Madam, Love brought me not where you ſaw me, nor thought I to find what I met with. Though my abſence from you, makes me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy enough, my condition is much more
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94436:86"/>to be lamented for the diſtraction cauſed by your belief of my infidelity. I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, were it poſſible, to accuſe you of any thing: But why ſhould you not aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your ſuſpicions? Why ſhould you break off a love in its infant ſweetneſs? No, you never loved me, ſince you could do thus. Farewel Madam, I ſhall never loſe the remembrance of having diſpleaſed you, yet I do love you, never ceaſed loving you, and have that inward ſatisfaction to know that I muſt for ever love you.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>She could not read this Letter without being touched at the very Soul. <hi>Fontper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis</hi> perceived it, and we having before any departure agreed upon a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhe ſent me word what effects my Letter wrought on Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs dream't not of my ſo ſudden departure; ſhe was now almoſt convinced, I had no intent to anſwer her kindneſs, ſince I had neglected taking leave of her.</p>
               <p>The Duke and Dutcheſs went next morning for <hi>Paris,</hi> where having ſtayed ſome time, the Duke attended the King towards the Siege of <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:94436:86"/>whether the Queen Mother likewiſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was waited on by Madam <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You went every morning to <hi>Fecamp</hi> to give an accompt to the King what had paſſed that night at the Siege. I ſeldom followed you for fear of ſeeing the Dutcheſs, leaſt the <hi>Admirale</hi> might have cauſe of complaint; but one day I could not excuſe my not going, the <hi>Conſtable</hi> ſending me. My Commiſſion being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I was juſt upon return when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> having heard of my being at <hi>Feeamp,</hi> under pretence of inquiring news from her Husband, made very heavy complaints of me. I very quietly heard them, and could not yet anſwer in the manner ſhe deſired. Prince <hi>Portian</hi> came luckily to take me off, and I returned to the Camp. This Prince had formerly great pretences on her heart, and it was thought he was beloved, he was ſtill in love; but now his cares and kindneſſes were not valued at a ruſh, I was the darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that could make no returns.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> being come ſome time before to <hi>Maule,</hi> informing her ſelf of the particulars of the Siege, underſtood that Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> went with the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94436:87"/>Queen; her jealouſie revived her love, ſhe feared the loſing me. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> gave me intelligence of all the <hi>Admirales</hi> thoughts, and I found my ſelf leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy then I thought. The ſame day that I aſſailed the Watch-Tower, which I made my ſelf maſter of, I received a Letter from the <hi>Admirale</hi> which ſpoke theſe words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>MY Anger and Reſentment cannot hold out againſt my love, I have nothing more to upbraid you with; and could I but ſee you, I ſhould think I had nothing more to deſire. But is not this too kind to you? Or do you deſerve this goodneſs? Were it not more juſt in me to hate you, purſuing the Counſels your unfaithfulneſs gives me? But alaſs, when I am apt to yield to that, the ſecret intelligences you have in ſpite of me, preſerved in my heart, blaſt all theſe thoughts. Yet you could not expect theſe expreſſions, and therefore muſt think them very kind. But I demand an equivalent repriſal, and will not be refuſed it, tell me not that your honor and glory oppoſe it, I will be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both; for all ſhould be renounced at the command of her you love. Diſmiſs your ſelf then from the Siege, what you loſe on the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:94436:87"/>ſcore of glory, you ſhall retrieve from the pleaſures of a paſſion, I will make happy. If you obey me not, never ſee me more, and ſuffer me to believe you prefer the ſight of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> D'Aumale <hi>before mine.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Never was Man in a greater plunge then I, I could not imagine which way to ſteer. Love offered me pleaſant and pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things, but I could not conſent to blemiſh my reputation by quitting the Siege. <hi>Saint-Cire</hi> was the firſt perceived the trouble I was in; ſince I always uſed his advice, I held it unfit to conceal from him the cauſe, who upon firſt hearing it, told, there needs no conſultation, on this matter. You muſt not ſtir, nor can your going off, be any way juſtified. Stay but till the Siege be ended, and then in the name of God, go ſee Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> as long as you will, and in the mean time take no heed of a Womans jealouſie or anger. Your Ladies will find out a return of kindneſs, when once their lover pleaſes them, and your peace will eaſier be made there then here, whatever Articles ſhe have againſt you. <hi>Saint-Cire</hi> was a true friend, and reaſon counſelled me to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice, but love would not liſten to it.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:94436:88"/>
               <p>The Treaty with the Town, which began about two hours after, eaſed me of my trouble, and made me determine to depart at the beginning of the night, taking along with me, onely one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. I got to Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> on the morrow, having rid that long way poſt, and on the Wings of Love. Never did I find in my ſelf ſo great a diſpoſition to joy and content. I was going to ſee the onely perſon in the World I loved beſt, and I was ſure to find her heart full of a violent Paſſion which I had begot there. I would not ſuffer her to be told I was come; but chuſing rather to ſurpriſe her myſelf, went directly up to her Lodgings, and into her Chamber which I found open. But is it to be believed, what I there ſaw? Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> in the arms of a Man, and Madam <hi>de Brions,</hi> as I thought, kiſſing him very lovingly. She perceived me, and came running towards me with an obliging air, the joy in her face diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing nothing but pleaſure; but what I had ſeen making me contemn all ſhe could offer me. Diſloyal Lady, ſaid I, what would you have with me? How wretched am I to have bin the witneſs of what I have ſeen. She held me by one arm, but not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94436:88"/>able to liſten to her, nor ſee her longer, I ſnatched away from her, mounted again my Horſe, and taking the road towards <hi>Havre,</hi> returned to the Camp.</p>
               <p>My melancholly was too great to be concealed. 'Twas thought to proceed, becauſe the Engliſh had not addreſſed themſelves to treat with me, when my Battery was neerer advanced then any other, but the true cauſe was never gueſt at, and you your ſelf were deceived as well as others. What lamentable reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did I make on my adventure, no cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el thought nor juſt ſuſpition but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> crime, and made me judge my ſelf the moſt unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Man living, becauſe I ſtill loved her guilty as ſhe was. Sometimes my Anger gained the day againſt my Love, but in few minutes, my Love again vanquiſhed my Anger: yet I would liſten to no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification ſhe writ to me, but I ſent back her Letters without opening them, and made her judge by all my proceedings that I broke off all Commerce; the time for giving judgement on our wager, was above a month expired, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have loſt, but it madded me to loſe by the treaſon of a Perſon I ſo well loved.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:94436:89"/>
               <p>The Siege ended, the King you know went to <hi>Roen</hi> to be declared Major, and thither came the <hi>Admirale,</hi> whom I took no notice of, amongſt all the Feaſts, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings and Delights. Madam <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> continued her endeavours to ſeduce a Heart I deſigned to keep at reſt, ſince the Perſon to whom I had given it, ſo ill treated it, in a time when I leaſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her rigor. I withſtood her kindneſſes beſt, by the care I took to ſhun her; that was enough to tell her I could not love, but my indifference increaſed her paſſion. Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out jealouſie behold all the Dutcheſs did to engage me, ſhe would not yet loſe me, and at laſt found out the ſecret to make me return. She nick'd the time to a hair, for I was juſt ready to comply with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D'Aumale</hi>'s love, and one day more had put me quite out of her reach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> whom ſhe had inſtructed what to ſay to me, talked a long time with me at the <hi>Ball;</hi> at firſt I had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to hear her, believing her an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice in the <hi>Admirales</hi> infidelity, but at length my anger abated, and ſhe made me conſent to come and ſee her on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:94436:89"/>
               <p>Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> who was ſtill in hopes her Beauty would at laſt affect me, ſeeing the diſcourſe held between me and <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis,</hi> feared ſomething was contriving contrary to her deſires, and therefore came to interrupt us, but my reſolution was taken, and having promiſed to ſee the <hi>Admirale,</hi> what ever kind or endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things the Dutcheſs could ſay, drew from me no other anſwer then a ſigh. She began to complain of my filence, and I know not how I ſhould have juſtified it, had not Prince <hi>Portian</hi> come up to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he left Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> no more that evening, and the company breaking up, I retired, not yet dreaming which way the <hi>Admirale</hi> would juſtifie her ſelf. She had made <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> ſay a thouſand things to me, not at all relating to the infidelity I accuſed her of. I thought onely to ſee her to make a tryal, whether there were yet in my heart any love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining for her.</p>
               <p>On the morrow I forgot not the hour appointed. I was brought to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and I found her to have diſmiſſed all other buſineſs onely to entertain me; ſhe appeared wonderful handſom, and every look had a charm, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94436:90"/>ſo much was I bewitched with her Air, Action, and Carriage, that I had nothing more to deſire to make me happy, but only to be perſwaded of her innocence, and now we were alone. What? you will forſake me then, ſaid ſhe, and can you thus eaſily reſolve to relinquiſh a paſſion begun with ſo much Eagerneſs, Fervency and Delight. Alas Madam, ſaid I, you ſnatch it from me by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty wherein you leave me of your Faith: and I reſtore it you, ſaid ſhe, by an aſſurance I never betray'd you. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay ſo much to me; the Beauty and Kindneſs of Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> have made you forget what was due to my Love, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a time when I loved you, told you ſo, and that you were ſenſible of it, and this in my own houſe, and in my own fight. What Treaſons have you not been guilty of to me? yet I forgave you, writ to you, you come and have ſcarce ſeen me, but you rudely leave me without giving me time to convince you, of the injuſtice of your ſuſpicions; ſince my arrival, you have never come nigh me, have ſearce been heard pronounce my name, nay have ſhun'd the very ſight of me. Go, you cannot love me, ingrateful
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94436:90"/>Man that you are: as ſhe ended theſe words, I ſaw a Man coming in by the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet door with his ſword drawn. I knew not at firſt what to think of it, but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the <hi>Admirale,</hi> I could hear her cry out, See there that dangerous Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val robs you of my heart; if you ſtill love me, you will defend your ſelf againſt him. I was ſat with one of my Arms thrown over the back of the Chair, and in that poſture ſurveyed this Man, whoſe fury had methought little terror in it; at length I thought it to be <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, and it was ſhe indeed, who, as Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> told me, I had under the ſame Maſque taken for a beloved Rival, when I came from the Siege of <hi>Havre</hi> to ſee her.</p>
               <p>My ſuſpitions being thus blown over, 'twas now my part to clear thoſe the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> had againſt me. What had paſſed on the Terrace of Orange Trees, ſhe could ſcarce forget; but now I was in love, and was loved again. it proved no hard matter to juſtify my ſelf; we renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a fair correſpondence, and <hi>Fontper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis</hi> perſwaded us 'twas the beſt way to baniſh all complaints, and let old ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions give place to Love. We had no
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94436:91"/>ſmall Intereſt to believe her, and we did ſo.</p>
               <p>She then propoſed, giving judgement who had won the wager. At that I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> and perceived ſhe bluſht, and ſtood ſilent. I drew a good Omen from her bluſhes, and no longer doubted, but my happineſs was neer. I beg'd her to conſent to Judgement, ſhe turned onely her Eies towards me and ſighed. That anſwer had a charm paſſed ſweetly unto my ſoul, and made me feel an unexpreſſible delight. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> knowing the favourable thoughts the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> had for me, asked both her and me, if we would ſtand to her judgement. Yes, yes, we will ſtand to it, ſaid I, judge us. Madam <hi>Brion</hi> cryed out, it was not fair I ſhould anſwer for her, without conſulting her mind, and would have withſtood the ſentence, but I entreated her ſo well, that ſhe was appeaſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> putting on the Looks and Formality of a grave Judge, with Sternneſs and Authority, pronounced in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ordain that Madam</hi> de Brion <hi>pay you the forfeit of the wager,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>and if ſhe fail, I condemn her never to love you
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94436:91"/>more.</hi> 'Tis an unjuſt ſentence, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, ſaid the <hi>Admirale;</hi> and to whom Madam, ſaid I, can you appeal? who will judge with more equity then Madam <hi>Fontpertuis?</hi> I know not, anſwered ſhe, but Love poſſibly will judge better. You may try then, ſaid <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, but I me of the mind his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not much differ from mine, at which ſhe was going out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the <hi>Admirale</hi> would have ſtaid her, but at laſt acepted her pretence of going to change her Habit.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> durſt not now come near me, Shame, Love, and Modeſty made her Bluſh, Sigh, and caſt down her Eies; I ſtept to her, and reaching out my hand, ſhe gave me hers, and looking up kindly at me; my Eies ſpoke to her, and ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood them, and I had no reaſon to be diſpleaſed at the anſwer ſhe returned me. I took notice ſhe had ſome Flowers in her boſome, I ſnatcht at them, and with a little reſiſtance got them; ſhe told me I ſhould not keep them, and I was willing to return them to the place whence I took them.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay any more for, we were both in love, and well ſatisfied
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94436:92"/>with one another, and our contents en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed before we ended this interview. It laſted three hours, and <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> at her return, ſoon perceived Love had given judgement in a manner different from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges, ſince neither one party nor the other complained.</p>
               <p>The next was yet a happier day for me, and thoſe which followed more. 'Tis hard to paſs from great ſufferings to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream joy, without being diſcovered. The Duke <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> who obſerved all my actions, ſooner believed my joy to proceed from my re-accommodation with the <hi>Admirale;</hi> my good fortune doubled, her jealouſie, and made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more melancholly and hateful. And though the Dutcheſs took kindly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Prince <hi>Portian</hi> talked to her of Love, yet ſhe could not forbear loving me more then I was willing; the content ſhe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> and my diligence to attend and wait on her wherever ſhe went, produced the ſame effects in her, my joy had done in the Duke; but I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not my ſelf to take notice of their diſguſts, or if ſometimes I did, 'twas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take pleaſure in them.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:94436:92"/>
               <p>One evening coming out of the <hi>Old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> I met Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> in the Queens Antichamber. I would have avoided her but could not, ſhe urged there all ſhe could, and made uſe of all the obliging ways imaginable, to make me unfaithful, but I anſwered her like a conſtant man, and I retired as ſoon as I could, though not till Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> who came by chance into that room, perceived our parly; ſhe grew a little jealous of it, but I ſoon appeaſed her, by promiſing never more to talk with the Dutcheſs.</p>
               <p>Mean time <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had not forgot the ſweetneſs of our converſation at her Aunts; ſhe had done me great ſervice, and thought ſhe deſerved ſome kindneſs. I ſaw her every time I went to the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales;</hi> I had an eſteem for her, ſhe was our Confident, and I was pleaſed with her, but ſhe was not ſatisfied with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference; one day thinking to find Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion</hi> in her chamber, I met there none but <hi>Fontpertuis.</hi> Her joy at ſight of me made me gueſs her thoughts, and I was returning to ſeek out the <hi>Admirale,</hi> when ſhe ſtop'd me in a manner that beg'd my ſtay, whither would you go, ſaid ſhe? you know not where to find Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94436:93"/>
                  <hi>de Brion,</hi> and why do you fly me? I was once thought worthy of a little Love; what has changed me? I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly ſerved you in your paſſion, and do not now deſire you ſhould love me for kindneſs ſake, onely love me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for gratitude.</p>
               <p>Whatever <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> could urge, I continued faithful, my refuſal tormented her, I could obſerve ſome ſigns of her anger and vexation, yet they wrought no effect on me, and I went off blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>There had for ſome days before great preparations been made for Running at the Ring. 'tis ſo ſmall time ſince you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have forgot what paſſed at it, and that I won one of the Rewards, which was a Picture-Caſe richly ſet with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; I deſtined it for Madam <hi>de Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> who at firſt thought it not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take it, but at length I made her reſolve to accept it. I had left it at my Lodgings, and would have ſent for it, but ſhe would not let me, telling me I might leave it with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> who would give it her at her return from the Queen: I went and brought it to <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> who imployed it to bring about a Treaſon, has
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94436:93"/>ſince coſt me a thouſand ſighs, and is ſtill the cauſe of thoſe torments; I cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcribe to you then by telling you, I am now as much deſerving pity, as I was worthy envy when I was beloved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> having got the Picture-Caſe, went to Madam <hi>D'Aumales,</hi> whom ſhe ſaw but ſeldom; yet ſhe had the cunning ſo to cloſe in with her, that ſpeaking of his Beauty and her Wit, ſhe paſſed from their Praiſes to the Glory that Man would poſſeſs, ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by her till ſuch time as the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs could no longer forbear diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe loved me; that I ingroſſed all the thoughts of her ſoul, and yet made no return of one, becauſe I was in love with Madam <hi>de Brion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had the knack to prevail ſo well o're the Ducheſs judgement, that ſhe made her believe, I no longer loved the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and that doubtleſs if ſhe made but the leaſt ſhow of a deſire of being beloved, I would make an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous return to her, utterly diſingaged from the charms of her Rival.</p>
               <p>We eaſily believe what pleaſes us, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> reſolved to write to me, and <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> undertook to give me her
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94436:94"/>Letter. Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> being returned from the <hi>Old Palace,</hi> asked if I had given her the Picture-Caſe; <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> made anſwer ſhe had not ſeen me, the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale</hi> wondred at my neglect, but ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>
               <p>On the morrow <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> gave me notice to come at the beginning of the night to Madam <hi>D'Aumales,</hi> where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Brion</hi> would be at play, I believed her, promiſed to go, and at the hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, came thither: Going in, I met a ſervant of Madam <hi>D'Aumales,</hi> who told me her Miſtreſs was gone forth, but that Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> and <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> were in her chamber, I went up and met <hi>Font<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertuis,</hi> who received me with ſuch a ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling countenance, as I could not ſuſpect of any Artifice or Deceit. I asked her where Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> was, ſhe told me in Madam <hi>D'Aumales</hi> little Chamber, ſhe was on a ſuddain troubled with a little Head-ach, and was lain down on the Bed. I went in, the Chamber was dark, and I had my mind full of the Image of what I loved, and perceived not the Treaſon practiſed againſt me, but committed one my ſelf againſt the <hi>Admirale,</hi> and knew it not; was ever ſuch perfidiouſneſs
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:94436:94"/>heard of, or could any Man be made more unhappy? Y'are very much to be pittied indeed, ſaid the Marſhal of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency,</hi> laughing to have obtained ſuch a favor from one of the fineſt Women of a Kingdom. I know not the Man would not have been glad to have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied your place, as ſcrupulous as you are to account the greateſt of pleaſures for an unſupportable torment. When one is in love, replied <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not the fineſt Women, but think one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe we love, and yet methinks, ſaid the Marſhal, you digeſted very well your kindneſſes to <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and are not ſo regularly faithful as you would have us believe. 'Tis true, replied <hi>D'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot,</hi> that I have not obſerved that max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime with her, but I was to work her to my deſigns, and could I better engage her to my intereſts, then by engaging her love. But pray proceed, ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, interrupting him, to tell us what you did in the little Chamber. I knew, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> by her voice, I ſighed for grief at the deceit put upon me, and was about to be gone, when <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> brought in Lights, and I ſaw not Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> but was alone with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94436:95"/>the Dutcheſs, ſo many Beauties, of which I might diſpoſe at pleaſure, made my heart utterly unfaithful; and upon tryal, I found that there is ſometimes as much pleaſure in Infidelity, as in a true and conſtant Paſſion. I renewed again and again my Diſloyalties to the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> and my Treaſon began to grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to me, when there had like to have hapned a ſcurvy accident.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>D'Aumale</hi> came home, and wanted but little to ſurpriſe us; <hi>Fontper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis</hi> came running in afrighted and had ſcarce the time to ſay, He followed her. I hid my ſelf behind the Bed, had I gone into the Chimney, as I was once thinking to do, I had periſhed either with the fire or ſmoak; for the Duke coming in pale and heavy, and his looks enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring him diſtempered, called for ſome fire, believing a fit of an Ague was ſeiſing on him. I knew not poſſibly how to get out; and Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> ſeemed to be in more trouble then I. Each of us were deliberating what was the beſt courſe to be taken, when it pleaſed my evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny to bring in Madam <hi>de Brion,</hi> who having heard I was at the Dutcheſſes, came either to know the truth, or to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94436:95"/>me in the very Act of Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her love. She met with <hi>Fontpertuis,</hi> and asking what her buſineſs was there, ſhe replied, I come, ſays ſhe, to ſatisfie my ſelf, about ſome ſuſpitions I have of <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> I am afraid he abuſes your love; he has been a whole hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone with the Dutcheſs, and is at preſent hid behind the Bed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Admirale</hi> upon this came in full of anger againſt her lover, and unable to endure the cruel injury, ſhe believed ſhe had received, the Dutcheſs began ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to apprehend her rage and reſentment. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> having carried her treachery thus far, went home to the <hi>Admirales,</hi> and left the perſons concerned in no little trouble and perplexity, brought on them by her cunning and artifice.</p>
               <p>The Duke whoſe Feavor augmented, not able to keep up any longer, retired into his Chamber, and went to Bed. Scarce was he gone out, but the <hi>Admirale</hi> mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly told the Dutcheſs ſhe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ill, and throwing her ſelf upon the Bed, pretending to have a pain at heart, ſhe leaned her head towards my ſide, and drawing the Curtain, gave me ſuch fierce looks as ſpoke a thouſand things to me,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94436:96"/>without uttering a word; when on a ſudden, her firſt diſſembled grief, became a true one, and I perceived her ſwound away.</p>
               <p>At that fight, without premeditating what might happen, I gave ſo grievous a ſhout, that almoſt all the houſe came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, I came out from behind the Bed, and endeavored to aſſiſt her what I could. My ſight had much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to her ſwouning, but the Picture Caſe which <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> had without my knowledge, given on my behalf to the Dutcheſs, was that compleated it; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> chanced to have that Caſe in her Pocket, and it was faln upon the Bed. The <hi>Admirale</hi> by chance laid her hand upon it, and looking to ſee what it was, knew it, and preſently imagined, that either I had given it the Dutcheſs, or that it was dropt out of my Pocket, whilſt I was tumbling with her on the Bed.</p>
               <p>The Duke returns to the Chamber, my ſight amazes him, and being jealous of both, he knew not which to reproach, his Wife, or the <hi>Admirale,</hi> who was long before ſhe recovered out of her ſwound. I took her by one of her hands, ſpoke
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94436:96"/>to her; ſhe at laſt opened her eyes, and ſeeing me, turned them towards the Duke, on whom, ſhe kept them a good while fixt. The Duke could not imagine what to make of this adventure, there was a ſecret in Madam <hi>de Brions</hi> diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which he would have given any thing in the World to diſcover.</p>
               <p>The Picture Caſe which he knew, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied his deſire, and he thence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the cauſe of the <hi>Admirales</hi> ſudden grief, and the Dutcheſs confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet he could not clear all the doubts his heart muſtered up, touching his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and his Love; neither by it, nor by the convincing knowledge he had of his Dutcheſs love for me, and his amorance, I enjoyed all the <hi>Admirales</hi> affection, not able therefore to ſtay there any longer, he retired into his Chamber.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Admirale</hi> reſtrained her Paſſion, and gave me not a reproaching word, but ſhe ordered me to be gone with all the authority of a commanding Miſtreſs. Madam <hi>D'Aumales</hi> eyes requeſted my ſtay, and ſeemed to entreat they might be preferred before Madam <hi>de Brions,</hi> but Love gained the day over Infidelity. I repented my crime, and went away more
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94436:97"/>in love with the <hi>Admirale,</hi> then I had ever been before.</p>
               <p>Soon after I was gone, ſhe retired to her Lodgings, not without eaſing ſome of her fury on Madam <hi>D'Aumale;</hi> who not caring at what rate ſhe gained my love, was little troubled at the diſcontent of her rival. <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> glad at this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, added new Treaſons to them, by telling Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> I had given the Picture Caſe to the Dutcheſs: That our correſpondence was ſetled, and that I had received a Letter from Madam <hi>D'Aumale;</hi> which ſhe had cunningly, and without ſuſpition got from me.</p>
               <p>All theſe apparent Truths, ſuch exact Reaſons of Suſpitions, and the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Fontpertuis</hi> inſpired into the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> made her reſolve never to love me more, but to abandon me to my incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and leave me maſter of the Dutcheſs heart, which I could not accept. I was guilty, but ſtill I loved, I would fain have been pardoned, and endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all I could, to deſerve that pardon by a ſincere and laſting repentance, which I had the better hopes of, becauſe I believed the <hi>Admirale</hi> could not refuſe it to that love and tenderneſs ſhe once had for me.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:94436:97"/>
               <p>We were in this condition when the King left <hi>Rouen.</hi> I have done all I could ſince to regain the <hi>Admirales</hi> good will, but cannot effect it. The Progreſs of the Court to <hi>Bayonne,</hi> not requiring my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, I ſtayed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and knowing that the Duke and Dutcheſs <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> the <hi>Admirale, de Brion,</hi> and Prince <hi>Portian,</hi> went to <hi>Fontainbleau.</hi> I am come hither either to diſturb their content, or with hopes ſo firmly to eſtabliſh my ſelf in the kindneſs and affection of the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> that nothing may hereafter ruine me. But I have yet been deceived in my hopes; Madam <hi>D'Aumale</hi> ſtill loves me, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes Prince <hi>Portian</hi> who loves her ſo well. The Duke continues my rival, I am fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leaſt he ſhould be happy, and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirale</hi> adds to my fear, by the obliging manner in which ſhe treats the Duke; and I am the more unhappy, becauſe I cannot renounce my love, nor ever hope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Madam <hi>de Brion</hi> to be touched with what I ſuffer, or to reſtore me to the ſame place I once poſſeſt in her heart.</p>
               <p>Your condition is not ſo bad as you think, ſaid the Marſhal <hi>de Moutmorency</hi> to <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> I know the very thoughts of the <hi>Admirales</hi> Soul, and am confident ſhe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94436:98"/>preſerves very kind ones for you, but you muſt deſerve them. What would you have me do to be happy, ſaid <hi>D'Andelot.</hi> Me thinks it is no hard task, replied the Marſhal, and were it my caſe, I would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the <hi>Admirale</hi> in her Chamber, caſt my ſelf at her feet, acknowledge my crime, refer my ſelf to her for puniſhment, joyn ſighs and tears to my repentance, promiſe never more to ſee Madam <hi>D'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,</hi> and in ſhort, not part from her, till I were as much beloved as I loved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D'Andelot</hi> took the Marſhal's counſel (who was a notable man in affairs of love, and whoſe ſtory ſhall follow <hi>D'Andelots</hi>) he ſurpriſed the <hi>Admirale,</hi> he ſighed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, till his grief made her relent; and that ſoon turned into love, and that love became as kind, as paſſionate, and as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as ever it had been before.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs <hi>D'Aumale</hi> was quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate, to have thus utterly loſt all hopes of <hi>D'Andelot,</hi> Prince <hi>Portian</hi> underrook to comfort her; but he ſucceeded not at firſt, but ſince Love and Patience over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the greateſt difficulties, it need not be wondered at, if they vanquiſh thoſe which would oppoſe their Felicity.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Battel of <hi>Jarnac</hi> was fought under the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the IX., the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> chief of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> loſt there his life, Admiral <hi>Chatillon</hi> rallied the ruines of the broken Army, and put his Brother <hi>D'Andelot</hi> into <hi>Cognac,</hi> who by his valor made <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Victory fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. 'Twas in this Field <hi>Buſſy D'Amboyſe</hi> began to give ſuch large aſſurances of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94436:99"/>what he one day would be, that <hi>Monſieur,</hi> though he loved him not, had the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity to praiſe him at the head of the whole Army.</p>
            <p>War had its time to revenge Hate and ſuſtain Authority; and Love muſt have his to create Pleaſures for thoſe who had the happineſs to reach them, and Pains and Sufferings for who were deſtined to be miſerable.</p>
            <p>Three months after this Battle, <hi>Buſſy</hi> conceived a deſign of gaining an eſteem in the heart of the Widow to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de St. Andre,</hi> the number of her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was great, he had reaſon to think his Rivals dangerous, but <hi>Buſsy</hi> feared nothing from Mankind, and hoped all things from his Merit and his Love.</p>
            <p>'Twas with the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroles,</hi> the favourite of <hi>Monſieur,</hi> that he was to diſpute the heart of the Lady <hi>Mareſhalle;</hi> There were many other Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, but theſe two were the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> tries all imaginable ways to pleaſe, he makes addreſſes to the Lady <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhale,</hi> he obſerves ſhe delights in them, he continues them, he becomes both pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and neceſſary, and makes himſelf be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94436:99"/>deſired; his Rivals believed they had reaſon to be jealous of him, and he took little care to perſwade them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>He durſt not ſpeak for a long time of his Love, but at laſt aſhamed of her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he breaks it. He goes into the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Mareſhales</hi> Chamber, at a time ſhe would not be ſeen. Mr. Lover, who let you in? ſaid ſhe, with a ſevere caſt of her Eye; return immediately: He feared he had diſpleaſed her, that fear was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Lady, ſhe perceived it, and recalled him, who was withdrawing, not expecting this return; I came to tell you Madam, ſaid he, that I am in love, you have put it into my heart, which all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might have attempted in vain; I comply with delight to all it inſpires, 'tis very tender, and what will not you loſe by being unſenſible? but Madam, I ſee you are angry, continued he, perceiving ſhe turned her Eies towards him, in a manner forbidding deſpair.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> was angry with her ſelf, that ſhe had caſt ſo kind a glance at <hi>Buſsy.</hi> Never ſee me more, ſaid ſhe, I cannot endure you; Take away my Love, and I conſent, ſaid he, interrupting her, I have
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94436:100"/>nothing to give you, nor nothing to take away, replyed ſhe, but once more I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you my ſight. <hi>Buſsy</hi> goes forth juſt at the ſame time that <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was told ſhe was not to be ſeen; he believed <hi>Buſsy</hi> happy, and that belief increas'd his grief without diminiſhing his Love. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> jealous and impatient, and who found no pleaſure in loving alone, prays the Lady <hi>Mareſhale</hi> to bear him company, but her heart beginning to be engaged, received coldly the Dukes propoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was the handſomeſt, and beſt proportioned Man in all the Court; yet his Love making no progreſs, he would at leaſt give ſome trouble to his Rivals, he entreats <hi>Monſieur</hi> to feign to love the <hi>Mareſhale. Buſſy</hi> who had preſerved ſome intelligence with <hi>Chareauneuf,</hi> let her know that ſhe was about to loſe <hi>Monſieurs</hi> heart, if ſhe found not a quick way to withhold it. Aſſoon as ſhe ſaw <hi>Monſieur,</hi> ſhe fills his Ears with reproaches and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, he juſtifies his Love and Fidelity, and promiſes no more to ſee the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſsy</hi> durſt not go near her, and <hi>Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles</hi> ſharply repaid the jealouſie he had given him.</p>
            <pb n="197" facs="tcp:94436:100"/>
            <p>The Court was at <hi>Paris</hi> but preparing for a Progreſs to <hi>Blois,</hi> where the Peace lately made with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> was to be Signed, and the Marriage Treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Madame,</hi> and the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> knowing that ſhe would not go this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, preſſed the obtaining ſome favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable anſwer, but ſhe declared for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was only obſerved in her, more civility towards the Duke, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance for <hi>Ligneroles;</hi> the Dukes Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly rejoyced <hi>Buſſy,</hi> but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> joy made him almoſt deſpair.</p>
            <p>The King was two days at <hi>St. Germains</hi> with <hi>Monſieur</hi> and a very ſmall number of Courtiers. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> entertaining the King, was ſo indiſcreet to let fall ſome words, made him ſuſpect that the ſecret of the Marriage of <hi>Madam</hi> with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was not unknown to him; <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> kept nothing from him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it was not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but he had diſcovered all the deſign. The King, who knew beſt the Art of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of any Prince in the world, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly interrupts him, by asking whither it was true that he loved the Lady <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhale,</hi> as much as ſome would perſwade
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94436:101"/>him, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> acknowledged that he did Love, but was not beloved. The King being in Bed, cauſed <hi>Monſieur</hi> to be called, with whom he grew ſo angry that he made him conſent to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and promiſe that he would not ſpeak to him of it, but nothing can be kept concealed from what we love; the King returns to <hi>Paris, Monſieur</hi> goes to viſit <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> ſhe perceives his ſadneſs, he ſuffered her Solicite a long time before he let her know the cauſe, and knowing it, ſhe condoled, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came partner in his grief without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting <hi>Ligneroles.</hi>

            <p>The King gave a Ball at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> takes out <hi>Ligneroles</hi> to dance. <hi>Buſsy</hi> believed her carriage not indifferent towards him, and that which doubled his grief and his jealouſie, was, that ſhe never ſo much as caſt her Eies on himſelf.</p>
            <p>He comes to <hi>Chaſteauneuf</hi> who had ſomething to ſay to him, the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> knew he had loved her, ſhe feared leſt Love ſhould be renewed between them, and <hi>Chaſteauneuf</hi> perhaps found an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, to which <hi>Buſſy</hi> agreed not.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:94436:101"/>
            <p>His heart no longer able to bear the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> diſdain, which he believed was cauſed by her kindneſs to <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> he reſolved to challenge him.</p>
            <p>The friendſhip of <hi>Buſsy</hi> with <hi>Grillon</hi> was begun ſome few days before, for he not enduring to live without Love in ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a Court, found Madam <hi>Bonneval</hi> the moſt proper to beget it in him; ſhe was a very well made perſon, but her Manners were more engaging then her Beauty; <hi>Grillon</hi> follows her in all places, ſhe perceives it, but forbids him not to follow her. What would you have with me <hi>Grillon?</hi> ſaid ſhe, one evening in the Queens Cloſet; All that ſhould be given to thoſe love well, <hi>Madam</hi> anſwered he; the King who overheard it, began to laugh; Madam <hi>de Bonnevall</hi> was vexed, and <hi>Grillon</hi> ſomewhat abaſhed: from that day forward, ſhe was very rigorous to him; he complained to <hi>Buſsy,</hi> who was beloved without knowing it. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſerve him with Madam <hi>Bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi> and without any longer delaying the effects of his promiſe, that very day he goes to her, and finding her alone; Who knows not, ſays he, that you are lovely, and that your Eies have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94436:102"/>ſecret of inchanting Hearts? but I was ignorant till now, that to ſo many Excellencies and ſo many Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are joyned ſuch ſtrange cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that the pleaſure of ſeeing you has for its certain conſequence ſuch mighty ſufferings, 'Tis that I come to complain of, continued he, (looking on her with an Eye full of Love without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſign) but I have ſome counſel to give you, will you receive it? continue I beſeech you, the chains of thoſe which adore you, 'twill be no great favour done them; 'tis ſo great a miſery to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that it becomes natural to wiſh for happineſs: Speak Madam, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſay, and give ſome joy to the unhappy <hi>Grillon,</hi> when <hi>Madame</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteauneuf</hi> came in, <hi>Buſſy</hi> conceiving he could not now continue the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had begun, went and found out <hi>Grillon,</hi> and gave him an account of what he had ſaid.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> believed not at all that it was on <hi>Grillons</hi> part ſhe had heard thoſe loving words, but on his own; ſhe was reſolved to have kindly anſwered <hi>Buſſy;</hi> had not <hi>Madame</hi> come in. He was the Man of all the world ſhe moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94436:102"/>to engage; ſhe loved him, and ſhe believed her ſelf Beautiful enough to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Love in him. This eaſily perſwaded her not to doubt, but it was the deſign of his heart, and not being capable of a cruel thought towards him, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over being perſwaded it might produce a good effect, to ſpare him any farther trouble, She ſent him this Note next Morning.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>LOve me, and tell me ſo, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you? And to let you ſee I am more lovely then you think, look here what Chains I command you to carry.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This Note was without ſuperſcription, and incloſed a Bracelet of Hair of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable weaving. <hi>Buſſy</hi> rejoyced he had ſo well ſucceeded in his amorous Embaſſie, as much as he would have grieved, had he known the tender goodneſs of Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> was addreſſed to himſelf, and not to <hi>Grillon;</hi> who was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, when <hi>Buſſy</hi> gave him both the one and the other, he applied to himſelf all the ſweetneſs was in that Note, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Bracelet as a favor, ſo much more worthy, becauſe leſs expected: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94436:103"/>himſelf happy, by an adventure had made him deſpair, had he known the truth of it. But how ſhould he come to learn it, if Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> without appearing, furpriſed at ſo ill tuned an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, does put on ſo cunning a diſguiſe that <hi>Grillon</hi> cannot know her thoughts; yet ſhe cannot digeſt the affront, it is a touch too ſenſible for Ladies, and they never pardon the ſlighting of their Beauty.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſerve for example, Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> ſtifles all the love ſhe had for him, and onely meditates revenge; ſhe alters not her behavior towards him, but endeavors to diſcover the cauſe of his refuſal. What is often ſaid of love is true, it cannot be long kept ſecret. Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> lets nothing ſcape may ſerve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the revenge as ſhe deſigns. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets and comments upon the Actions, the Looks, the Words of <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and draws thence Suſpitions, which become Truths, and tell her he is in love. One day ſhe was with the Lady <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> when <hi>Buſſy</hi> comes there, but his carriage ſeemed ſo unconcerned, that none but Madam <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neval</hi> could have divined his thoughts. Not able long to contain, he throws on
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94436:103"/>the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> ſuch amorous glances, that Madam <hi>Bonneval</hi> perceived them, though he durſt not ſigh ſo loud as to be heard: She diſcovered love in the eyes of <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and was enraged, it was not all for her; by all theſe ſigns, ſhe knew he was deeply intangled. And the more ingenuouſly to advance her revenge, ſhe doubles her appearances of Friendſhip, and under the falſe reſemblances of a complacent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, which ſhe affected, ſucceſsfully labors to create confidences with the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> had deſigned to ſight <hi>Ligneroles</hi> on the firſt occaſion preſented; on the morrow one brake forth, the King would ſpeak with him, he loved him, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a good iſſue of any dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, if entruſted to him. The King comes into his Cloſet, where he was told he attended, and propoſed the killing of <hi>Ligneroles.</hi> Can you have any eſteem for me Sir, anſwered <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and make choice of me to rid you of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> by unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ways. Ah <hi>Buſſy,</hi> ſaid the King, what will not any Man undertake to revenge himſelf of a beloved Rival, and to ſuſtain the Intereſt of his King, when he finds in his own Courage a ſecurity for the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94436:104"/>execution, and that his Soveraign abbets the action. But what ever the King could ſay, or promiſe, he could not make <hi>Buſſy</hi> conſent to his deſires. In this deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate affair, he becomes the friend of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and chuſes rather to expoſe himſelf to the Kings anger, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the merits of his Rival, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he might one day render him, then to oblige his revenge at the expence of his honor and reputation. The King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ill ſatisfied with <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s generous thoughts; but in his Soul approved what he ſeemed to condemn; yet forbidding him upon pain of death, once to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Propoſition he had made him, <hi>Buſſy</hi> anſwers nothing and withdraws.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> who had grown into great confidences with the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> (though not ſuch ſecret ones as <hi>la Hermite,</hi> who was one of her attendants) tells her that one of her people had ſeen <hi>Buſſy</hi> go to <hi>Chateauneuf's,</hi> but ſhe drew falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures from this viſit. <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> had ſent for <hi>Buſſy</hi> to come to her Lodgings, to tell him the deſign the King had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> believing he knew it not. She loved <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and the love he had for the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> hindred him from anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94436:104"/>her love. She believed <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was beloved, and that by preſerving his life, <hi>Buſſy</hi> might loſe the hopes of ever affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lady <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> and then ſhe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her ſelf he might return to her. Directed by ſuch prudent policy, ſhe told him the cauſe of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> diſgrace, as ſhe had learnt it from <hi>Monſieur,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him, that it was more glorious to overcome a Rival by generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, and by advertiſing him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was deſigned, then to triumph over his evil Fortune, by concealing from him, that the Kings moſt cruel reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ready to fall upon him. <hi>Buſſy</hi> hears all <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> would ſay on this ſubject, without promiſing any thing, ſave onely to be ſecret in his having learnt it of her. He perceived by her carriage, that ſhe deſired an entertainment like to thoſe they had had together in the time they loved; but that time was paſſed, love had diſpoſed of <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s heart, in favor of the <hi>Mareſhale;</hi> and though <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> were one of the faireſt perſons of <hi>France,</hi> and employed now all her charms which had formerly ſeemed ſo alluring; and let him now hear a thouſand flattering and pleaſant things, he ſtill remained conſtant,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94436:105"/>and parted from her without giving the leaſt reaſon to be reproached, as to his love.</p>
            <p>Underſtanding that <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was in the Garden of the <hi>Hoſtel</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> he goes thither; and after having drawn him off ſome paces from the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> who was with Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> I was reſolved yeſterday to kill you as a Rival, whoſe happineſs made me deſpair, ſaid <hi>Buſſy</hi> to him, to day I would endeavor to preſerve you as an honeſt, but unhappy Man, who have, doubtleſs, neither deſerved death by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> maximes of State, nor the particular hate of the King. I ſhould have received you as an enemy fit to be feared, anſwered <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> but I dread you more with the merit wherewith now you appear, and if poſſible, I would ow you nothing. In vain I examine and ſearch my ſelf, in what point I can be guilty. You are not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, replied <hi>Buſſy,</hi> ſince you have let the King perceive you were not ignorant, that the marriage of <hi>Madame,</hi> and the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> was onely an ingenuous pretext, the more fecurely to ruine the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> The ſilence and confuſion of <hi>Ligneroles</hi> accuſed him, and he had now
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94436:105"/>no hopes but in <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Protection, he could not believe himſelf forſaken by him, but <hi>Buſſy</hi> aſſured him of it. My crime is, having ſpoken, ſays he, at length, but I had rather die, then doubt of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs</hi> friendſhip, he knows not my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is reſolved; for he who never kept ſecret from me, would not have concealed a deſign againſt my life.</p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>Buſſy</hi> could alledge, he would not take the adviſe he gave him not to go this progreſs, nor take the ways to ſecure himſelf he offered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligneroles</hi> ſpoke after this of the Lady <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> The eſteem I have for you, ſaid he, hinders me from concealing the eſtate wherein my love, and ſervices have put me with her, I love her and ſhe knows it, I have ſighed, I have complained, and all the fruit I have gathered from all this, is the pleaſure to ſee my ſelf hopeleſs; you, believed there were ſtrong ties of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between us, and it was my intereſt not to diſabuſe you, ſhe wanted one of the family to keep up her affairs with <hi>Monſieur.</hi> I was capable of ſerving her, and you took for love, that aſſiduity ſhe permitted me, rather to give her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of my Negations, then to give me
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:94436:106"/>marks of her goodneſs. Ah <hi>Buſſy,</hi> muſt I tell it you, continued <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> for you onely is reſerved the happineſs to affect her Soul, and ſhe ſees you not, onely for fear of loving you too much. That fear ſhould be a glory and pleaſure to you, Proceded he, ſighing, what would not I do to inſpire the like? But you would be unfortunate, if ſuch a thing were, which is, what I cannot deſire at ſuch a price after that you have now done. Are you ſo generous, replied <hi>Buſſy,</hi> to tell your Rival in good earneſt, that he is not hated? I am unhappy enough to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, for not being loved, ſaid <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> interrupting, and that I am in danger of loſing my life, and need not be ſuſpected to want ſincerity towards the Man I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem moſt of all the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> who obſerved them, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Diſcourſe might end in a quarrel, but her apprehenſions changed ſubject, when ſhe beheld them embrace.</p>
            <p>Her ſuſpicions of <hi>Buſſy</hi> increaſed, ſhe was jealous of <hi>Chateauneuf:</hi> Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences at the Ball, and the impreſſions of his viſiting her, much perplexed her mind; and beſides that, he parted from <hi>Ligneroles</hi> more like a Friend then a Rival.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94436:106"/>What then, had ſhe not reaſon to fear? Ladies would loſe nothing; they believe the number of their lovers is a mark of their merit, and an increaſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. I ſay not the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> had theſe thoughts, but ſhe could not look upon the ſemblances of his change, but as an injury in his judgment. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by their actions they were become Friends, and that <hi>Buſſy</hi> had yielded to <hi>Ligneroles;</hi> all the pretentions he had on her heart, ſhe ſeemed to have more ſcorn for <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and more fierceneſs for <hi>Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toles,</hi> when they met the Queen, who ſoon after went to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> with her.</p>
            <p>Theſe Rivals went together from the <hi>Hoſtel de Soiſſons. Ligneroles</hi> was aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by four unknown men, who cryed out to <hi>Buſſy,</hi> they would have onely the life of <hi>Ligneroles;</hi> but all the anſwer he gave, was to let them know, it was hard to take that from a man he defended. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> oppoſed his courage to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies numbers, and conjured <hi>Buſſy</hi> to let him periſh alone, and not run the hazard of loſing his life, either by theſe Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, or by the anger of the King, who would not want advice of the aſſiſtance he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94436:107"/>gave him: <hi>Buſſy</hi> impatiently endured what <hi>Ligneroles</hi> ſaid, and parry'd moſt part of the thruſts made at him. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> chancing, at this moment, to paſs by, took their part; the four men yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the courage and conſtancy of the Duke, <hi>Buſſy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles;</hi> they fled in diſorder, ſome of them wounded, and one of them was taken by <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s ſervants, whom <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> let go againſt the Dukes mind, not doubting, but from him, might be learned the firſt authors of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. But <hi>Buſſy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, commanded by the King, drew off the Duke from thoſe ſuſpicions he might have had, by feigning a Family quarrel which they would revenge. This aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate made a great noiſe, and <hi>Monſieur</hi> talked publick, That he made <hi>Ligneroles</hi> caſe his own, but in private he ſaid other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: He knew from whence the blow came, and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The King who was violent in the firſt eruptions of his anger, was about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94436:107"/>mand the arreſting of <hi>Buſſy</hi> for aſſiſting <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and whom he believed had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his ſecret; but the eſteem he had for him, baniſhed this deſign of revenge.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had no ſhare in the Kings reſentments, not being at all faulty: <hi>Buſſy</hi> came that Evening to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and ſaw the King, who received him with many praiſes for the action he had done, though he did not approve it; but he underſhood diſſimulation. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſent to requeſt of the Lady <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> he might have the honor to kiſs her hands, he had never ſpoke to her ſince ſhe had forbid him ſeeing her. She was full of anger, and of ſhame, and could not prevail over her heart, to bring it to that indifference ſhe deſired, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her agreement to <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s requeſt.</p>
            <p>Juſt as her anſwer was brought to him, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> came into his Chamber, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, and aſſured him he would omit nothing poſſible for him to do, to procure him an enterview with the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> It is hard to be obliged for ſuch a kindneſs to a Rival, but <hi>Buſſy</hi> was conſtrained to it. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was ſtill of the ſame mind not to retire from Court; and <hi>Buſſy</hi> argued hard againſt a reſolution, which had no
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:94436:108"/>other foundation then <hi>Monſieurs</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, on which he had much leſs reaſon to conſide, then on a provident and quick withdrawing, which was the onely way to fecure him. <hi>Ligneroles</hi> came to the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> and at firſt pleaded in vain on <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s behalf, but at laſt ſhe conſented to ſee him. She after asked him, who were thoſe had aſſaulted him; he would not tell her the ſecret, but he told her that without <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s aſſiſtance he had been in very great danger, and that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> had likewiſe defended him.</p>
            <p>It was agreed between them, that <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſhould come after Supper, and that on condition he brought him, which he did. She was beginning to be undreſt, and deſired him to be preſent at their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to deprive <hi>Buſſy</hi> of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he might find in ſeeing and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her alone, which <hi>Buſſy</hi> feared, but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> who would not be genenous by halfs, civilly retired, and by his retreat left him full liberty to ſee, ſpeak, and he heard. She went for a moment into the Alcove to change her ſhift, whilſt <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſtaid looking on a Picture of a Mignon love which endeavored to climb to the top of a Rock, he drew a Pencil out of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:94436:108"/>his Pocket to write, <hi>I ſhall drrive,</hi> when the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> gave a great ſhriek, and came running almoſt naked into his arms. Such a ſight would certainly affect one indifferent, what then could be <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s thoughts who was in love. He ſtopt her, asking the cauſe of her ſright, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to reaſſure her; but he perceived ſhe ſwounded, and was in condition to create extaſies of love: So that <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſuckt in pleaſures at his eyes, their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was to him obliging and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they ſhowed him curious things; it is impoſſible to expreſs the ſweet and tender motions of his Soul, love onely can do it; but love is diſcreet, and tells not all it feels. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> who was as fraid as her Lady, was fled to call other Maids to her aſſiſtance, whilſt <hi>Buſſy</hi> endeavored to bring her to her ſelf.</p>
            <p>They entred readily into the Chamber, followed by <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> who being got onely to the Stairs foot, ran back in haſt to know the reaſon of the noiſe he heard. How was he ſurpriſed, How aſtoniſhed, And how afflicted, all at once, to ſee the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> in the arms of one ſhe loved? What jealous thoughts did not this ſight inſpire him with? He believed himſelf
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94436:109"/>unhappy, but, what thought he not of the happineſs of his Rival? Yet thoſe thoughts gave place to others more ſad and grievous, when he perceived that all <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s trouble proceeded from the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhales</hi> ſwounding. They put her in Bed, and ſoon after ſhe opened her eyes, and her fright being allayed, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> and he withdrew. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> had as was well known a ſtrong natural antipathy againſt Spiders, of which ſhe could tell no cauſe; ſhe then ſaw one on the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſaved her ſelf whereever ſhe could, and <hi>L'Hermite</hi> ſharing in her Miſtreſs fright, fled as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>On the morrow <hi>Buſſy</hi> returned with deſign to ſee her, but the ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſſion wherein ſhe was to be ſeen, in a condition ſo contrary to Modeſty, made her reſolve to refuſe a pleaſure, ſhe would gladly have received, under pretence of not being well recovered from her fright.</p>
            <p>He divined one part of her thoughts, but unwilling to be a ſecond time obliged to <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> and truſting in <hi>Neufville,</hi> he gave him Commiſſion to let the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> know he had ſome important buſineſs to diſcourſe with her. <hi>Neufville</hi> did it, but not being happy in ſerving his Friend, he
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94436:109"/>in vain attempted to perſwade her, ſhe ought to hear what <hi>Buſſy</hi> had to ſay to her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Buſſy</hi> was to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, he had not onely the pangs of his love, and the cruelties of the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> to groan under, but muſt likewiſe endure all that grief cauſed by <hi>Ligneroles</hi> his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> aſſiſted by the Counſels of Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> who he had formerly loved, and who was ſtill his friend, neglected nothing he thought might make him be beloved. This Prince was young, brave, ambitious, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, every way lovely and deſerving; but to what end were all theſe great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, whilſt he was not beloved; and yet made all his happineſs conſiſt in the being ſo.</p>
            <p>But in a Conference he had, his love changes object; it was with his Uncle, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who having already broke off the Match between <hi>Madame,</hi> and the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> would do the like with the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and by his credit with Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Medices,</hi> marry her to his Nephew. The love he had for the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> withſtood this great
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94436:110"/>Fortune, but the intereſt of his family, and his ambition made him comply with what was deſired. He began therefore in more ſteddy manner, to fix his thoughts on <hi>Madame,</hi> and conſidering her as the daughter of a great King, and whoſe Wit and Beauty might pleaſantly revenge him of the rigors of his Miſtreſs, he ſteered all his love and cares towards her. This change ſurpriſed Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and afflicted not at all the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grillons</hi> Conſtancy was yet unhappy, Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> was perplexed and melancholly, ſhe had laid deſigns which ſhe could not execute, and <hi>Grillon</hi> muſt ſuffer for it. He was impatient, and would have love immediately returned for love, and the refuſing him with any ſharpneſs, the recompence he requeſted, was enough to make him believe there was none to give. Sometimes anger and ſuſpition tempted him to inconſtancy, but when he thought to love no longer, one glance of Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> recalled him to his Chains.</p>
            <p>She thought on nothing but revenge on <hi>Buſſy,</hi> for being in love with the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> She knew almoſt all paſſed in her heart, her inclination for <hi>Buſſy</hi> was no ſecret to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94436:110"/>her, but ſhe ſtrove to leſſen it by her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and counſels, and by the cunning ſhe had to poſſeſs her with the thoughts of his love to <hi>Chateauneuf.</hi> In ſum, ſhe made her ſo aſhamed of her thoughts, that the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> could not have kept them alive, had ſhe not been ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed with the worth and honeſty of <hi>Buſſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligneroles</hi> had onely ſome ſhows of <hi>Monſieurs</hi> favor, <hi>Dugua</hi> had the ſubſtance, whoſe ſubtile ſpirit, raiſed ſo many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and cauſed ſo many diſorders. Yet ſo cunningly was his diſgrace concealed, that he could never diſcover, whether he had conſented to his death; the ſame ſigns of truſt and friendſhip ſtill appeared, but all thoſe ſigns were onely kept up like falſe lights to deceive him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> not able to diſabuſe him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Grillon,</hi> very rarely left him.</p>
            <p>Beauty, good Men, Birth, and love in <hi>Monſieur,</hi> could not baniſh from <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf</hi> the Paſſion ſhe had for <hi>Buſſy,</hi> ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> happineſs, and the difficulty ſhe foreſaw, would be found in depriving her of her lover, ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed her deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neufville</hi> not having ſucceeded with the <hi>Mareſhale, Buſſy</hi> reſolved himſelf to ſpeak
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94436:111"/>to her, and his attempt was happy. She was ready to go forth, but her confuſion was ſo great at the ſight of <hi>Buſſy,</hi> that ſhe would have drawn back into her Cloſet; but he placing himſelf before her in a Suppliant, and reſpectful poſture; Stay Madam, ſaid he, I come not to ſpeak of my love, but of <hi>Ligneroles.</hi> You know him, continued he, ſeeing ſhe ſtayed to hear him, and you know he loves you. A little of your pitty would be a great allay of thoſe cruel ſufferings his Paſſion torments him with, and I ſhall be happy in obtaining what I requeſt for him. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> bluſht with anger at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Buſſyes,</hi> not doubting but he had given over loving her, but willing to conceal her concernment. You ſhall not obtain what you pretend from me, replied ſhe, I find I have no diſpoſition to do good, and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> is to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, if he accounts upon any favorable thoughts. I have none, my heart is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to whatever I will, and I fear not its betraying the intereſts of my glory, to take part with thoſe of my love: Madam, replied he, Treaſon is eaſily pardoned when we find a ſweetneſs in being betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſince you will find a great deal
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94436:111"/>in this crime; if your heart commit it, you will, without doubt, be induced to pardon the fault, by the pleaſure you will receive, in loving, and being beloved. Remember then <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> Madam, he is unhappy without deſerving it; he has a tender and violent Paſſion, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate to what he loves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his deſtruction is reſolved. I come to tell you of it, who ſhould have been the miniſter of the Kings revenge, he would have obliged me to have killed him; and <hi>Monſieur</hi> has reſigned him to thoſe cruel Reaſons of State, may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly produce effects diſmal to all <hi>France;</hi> it is not from him I ſpeak this, he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant I preſt to a ſight of you; nor durſt I have done it for myſelf, but I thought I could not neglect ſerving him, without leaving my ſelf liable to juſt reproach; he had already been loſt without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> gave him. Say without yours, ſaid the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, and fear not I ſhall value you too much: That which you tell me, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes me not without cauſe, and I ſhould hardly believe all you have ſaid, were I not well perſwaded of your ſincerity; but what can I do for <hi>Ligneroles?</hi> I have
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94436:112"/>not any power; you have an abſolute one over his heart, replyed <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and the Commands of a Perſon beloved may gain from him, what neither the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels nor Prayers of a friend can hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to do. Employ your Beauty to oblige him not to go this progreſs, and let him know, he has now no part in <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and that his death is unavoidable, if he withdraw not from Court. This Madam is all that I have to ſay, can you now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of me, or are you at all troubled to have heard me? She was about to anſwer when <hi>Ligneroles</hi> entred, from whom ſhe concealed not the leaſt circumſtance of what had been ſaid to her. My deſtiny's very ſtrange, ſaid <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> to find more ſuccor from a Rival, then from the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a Man I have ſo long ſerved, or from the heart of a Miſtreſs I have ſo dearly loved. No Madam, I deſerve not your love, one alone is worthy of it, if any can be, his thoughts are ſo Noble and Virtuous, his Love ſo excelling, his Heart ſo great, he poſſeſſes all qualities required in a true brave Man, and all that the moſt delicate Lady can deſire in a Lover; Therefore love <hi>Buſſy,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he ſighing. Hold, ſaid <hi>Buſsy,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94436:112"/>your indiſcretion ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> could not enough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Character of theſe two Lovers; <hi>Buſſy</hi> refuſed to rid himſelf of <hi>Lignero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> it was as much as his life was worth to let ſcape the ſecret entruſted him by the King, he believed it not important, not enough to make Honour its ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he adviſed <hi>Ligneroles</hi> of the deſigns againſt him, and defended him after that againſt thoſe the King ſent to take away his life. He ſpeaks of the Love of <hi>Ligne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles,</hi> and not only endeavors to ſerve him as a friend, but eſſays to make him be beloved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligneroles</hi> ſoul yields not in greatneſs to <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s, he declares himſelf unworthy of his concern for him, praiſes his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and pronounces him alone worthy of Love. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> ſeeing <hi>Buſsy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to withdraw; ſtay, ſaid ſhe, and be witneſs, I will ſpare nothing to ſave <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> but all her goodneſs proved in vain, he let her know he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuſe to die out of too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in <hi>Monſieurs</hi> friendſhip, then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly accuſe him by his flight of having conſented to his death. <hi>Buſſy</hi> joyned
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94436:113"/>his Counſels and Reaſons to the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhales,</hi> but he remained firm in his reſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of going the progreſs. The next day the King hunted with the Queen, <hi>Madume,</hi> and ſeveral other Ladies, all on horſeback. After having for ſome time chaced an Hare, which the Dogs eat, the King had a deſire to take ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with a Ferret; ſaying, He would kill all came out of their Buries. Theſe woods were obſerved by the <hi>Hugenots,</hi> and Politicians, and they drew judicious conjectures from his humour, which might have ſerved to ſecure them againſt thoſe cruelties acted ſoon after upon them, but they ſuffered themſelves to be deceived by Soveraign Faith, by the cunning of <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> and by the Honours and Dignities they received.</p>
            <p>At this Chace the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was ſtill neer <hi>Madume,</hi> taking the ſame courſe to win Love from her as he had done with the <hi>Mareſhale, Buſſy</hi> carefully obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the Duke did, to whom the Queen had made a ſigne to come ſpeak with her, juſt at the ſame time that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi> having taken notice of <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, called to him to know the reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:94436:113"/>
            <p>In the laſt Aſſembly at the <hi>Louvre</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid he, I obſerved that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> always had his Eies turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and ſeeing nothing ſo perfect and accompliſhed as he, I wiſht he might fall in love, for I thought you alone a worthy object of his paſſion. I had thoſe thoughts when you took him out to dance, I obſerved his joy when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your hand, and the bluſhes that ſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you. In ſumme, <hi>Madame,</hi> I employed ſo well my Eyes, that I could not doubt but you might one day love. I know not but I might be deceived, but it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, as if the day approached; this is what I obſerved, <hi>Madame,</hi> when you took notice of my hearkening to you.</p>
            <p>She begun to laugh at what he had ſaid; you fetch your conjectures a great way off, ſaid ſhe, but I have too much eſteem for you, to leave you in an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that I will ever diſpoſe my heart to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> To whom then that is worthy of it, can you give it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, if you refuſe it to him? To <hi>Buſſy,</hi> interrupted ſhe, inclining her ſelf towards him, when he ſhall ceaſe to love the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> Ending theſe words, ſhe rid off, leaving him confuſed, and not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:94436:114"/>knowing what to think; how many reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did he make on this adventure. He believed <hi>Madame</hi> had a mind to divertiſe herſelf with him, rather then hoped, ſhe had any deſign of inſpiring him with the boldneſs of making love to her.</p>
            <p>The Chaſe ended, all returned to <hi>Paris.</hi> In the way, <hi>Buſſy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Madame</hi> had delivered them from ſo dangerous a Rival. He received with a good Grace, what they ſaid on that point, not utterly diſowning his love to her, and yet not ſeeming too much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have it believed.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> was at this hunting, and would fain have perſwaded the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhale,</hi> that <hi>Buſſy</hi> had held ſome amorous Propoſitions with <hi>Madame,</hi> but ſhe began to give leſs Faith to what ever ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſay againſt him. He was grown powerful in her heart, his merit, his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous thoughts, and above all the love which had touched her, had made him gain a place in the tendreſt receptacle of her Soul, from whence it was very hard to ſnatch him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> was ignorant what his happineſs was, and deſpaired of being beloved. A
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94436:114"/>great delight which ſurpriſes us, when we leaſt ſuſpect it, is that brings moſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with it. <hi>Buſſy</hi> made this pleaſant try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he could not think himſelf happy, but how joyful was he when he could not doubt it.</p>
            <p>The Court prepared to depart next morning, and the Courtiers took leave of thoſe Ladies did not go the progreſs. <hi>Buſſy</hi> intended not to take his of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhale,</hi> fearing to offend her by his ſight, and by this reſpectful and prudent car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he light upon the ſecret of making himſelf be deſired not to go without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, he thought not to find her at Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> Lodgings, whom he believed his friend, and therefore would not omit waiting on her, having employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the time he thought neceſſary in this viſit, he roſe up to be gone. How will <hi>Buſſy</hi> part then without ſeeing me? ſaid the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> to him; he anſwered, that before he durſt not, but now he took what ſhe had ſaid for a Command.</p>
            <p>He failed not to attend the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> about two hours after her going from Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who the better to deceive him, had at his going out, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him of her friendſhip in a manner,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94436:115"/>that appeared ſo full of fair Faith, that he went away well perſwaded he had not a better friend then ſhe, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſhe would be ſerviceable to him in his Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſsy</hi> was ſo quick-ſighted as to have obſerved that the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> began hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to purge away her errors of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and with ſuch ſweet reflexions, and ſuch kind thoughts he came to her; his Looks were full of Languiſhing and Submiſſiveneſs, and his Words full of Love and Eloquence. He ſpoke at firſt of what he felt, of the torments abſence would create, and of his fears to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> anſwered to all this, or rather her paſſion anſwered for her. In the ſequel of the diſcourſe ſhe made ſome complaints, but they were obliging ones; ſhould you permit me, ſaid ſhe, to have the leaſt occaſion to reproach you? Could you goe without ſeeing what you love, is it thus you would perſwade your paſſion? or do you know how to love? better then you Madam, replyed he, you dare not ſtand the tryal, for then you would find all the knowledge is on my ſide, and therefore you would ſave your ſelf that ſhame; ſhe bluſht at this anſwer,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94436:115"/>and asked if he went with the King. No Madam, you have affronted me, ſaid he, and being reſolved to be revenged, I am not now for the progreſs: and what revenge can you take of me, replyed ſhe? as I can acknowledge Benefits, ſo I am ſenſible of Injuries, and let me adviſe you that 'tis dangerous making me your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Whatever you can ſay Madam, ſaid <hi>Buſſy,</hi> interrupting her, my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fixt, and without fearing your threats, I muſt attempt to make you love me; this enterpriſe will diſpleaſe you, and then I at leaſt ſhall have the delight to have given you ſome vexation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge your ſelf every day thus upon me, replyed ſhe, I ſhall know how to give af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front for affront, and then I ſhall have the pleaſure of not having yielded to you in reſentment. This diſcourſe gave much relief to <hi>Buſsy,</hi> who was before in great diſquiet, out of the uncertainty he was in of the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> thoughts for him, but never found Lover more kind ones, nor greater hopes of happineſs, when <hi>l'Hermit</hi> came to give notice that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> entred.</p>
            <p>His new paſſion could ſcarce ſubſiſt, his heart lean'd towards what he had ſo much
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94436:116"/>loved, and all the glory of <hi>Madames</hi> Beauty could not leſſen his grief, that he could not bend the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> heart. He came to make the laſt Tryal of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming it, but <hi>Buſsy</hi> having already done it, and having Deſert and Love enough to preſerve his Conqueſt, the Duke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> he was paſt hope.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> having given him the occaſion by her arrival, he took leave. <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> came with her, with deſign ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to break off the converſation of <hi>Buſſy</hi> with the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> or to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all that paſſed, but ſhe came too late, and <hi>Buſſy</hi> retired, unwilling to beget a jealouſie in his Miſtriſs, or hopes in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teauneuf; Grillon,</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> went home with him to ſupper. After they were gone, he began to think of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and how bleſſed a thing it was to be well-beloved; his heart had not been accuſtomed to ſuch delight, nor could he reliſh it with moderation, but coming afterwards to examine cloſer what his good fortune was, he found ſomething wanting, which he reſerved till the morrow, to deſire his Miſtriſs to perfect.</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:94436:116"/>
            <p>The Court was to lie at <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> he feigned to begone, and underſtanding the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> was in her chamber, he was brought in by <hi>L'Hermite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What come you hither for? ſaid ſhe, at his entrance, I believed you already gone; and was preparing to rail at you: he was about to anſwer when one came in to tell her, that Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> deſired to ſee her. <hi>Buſſy</hi> deſired the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhale</hi> he might be hid, becauſe he was believed to be gone, and being found there, they would ſuſpect he had a great intelligence with her. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took that care, who thruſt him into a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet near the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> Bed, whilſt ſhe went to meet them, leſt they ſhould perceive <hi>Buſſy</hi> was with her. She masked her ſurprize at their arrival, by feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Headach; Madam <hi>de Bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> propoſed remedies for it, but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them, and her friend divined not thoſe would have done it. Perhaps ſhe had deſired not to be interrupted. <hi>Buſſy</hi> was in a flame of Love, and in a fair road, and I doubt not but he would have ſtood in it. Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> apprehending
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94436:117"/>the grief leſs then it was, endeavored to be perſwaded, made their viſit very long. Love has its impatiencies, judge thoſe of <hi>Buſsy.</hi> Hearing eaſily all that was ſaid in the chamber; he overheard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> ask the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> what was a clock, for ſhe muſt be gone at ten, and reaching to a ſounding Watch that hung in the Cloſet, he made it ſtrike that hour. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> who knew her Watch went right, eaſily conceived <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi> had put it forward. In ſhort, Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> and the Duke went and left them a full liberty of entertainment.</p>
            <p>After having given ſome Orders to <hi>L'Hermite,</hi> ſhe opened the Cloſet door, and <hi>Buſſy</hi> came into her chamber, when immediately a great noiſe was heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and word brought there was fire, and that the Flames increaſed: ſhe would have ſeen her Houſe burn, and her Houſhold-ſtuff, well known to be the moſt Magnificent of the Kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed without the leaſt trouble, but the fear ſhe was in of <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s danger, cruelly afflicted her; and notwithſtanding the arrival of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> ſhe would go into the Cloſet where <hi>L'Hermite</hi> had once more hid him, when the Flames that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94436:117"/>from the door made her believe her Lover was conſumed. What a loſs at the point of being happy, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing <hi>Buſsy</hi> for all his Labor and his Love! ſhe ſwounded, and none but <hi>L'Hermite</hi> at preſent knew the cauſe. <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroles,</hi> who was to part next morning, paſſing by that Street, ſaw the neighbors run towards her Houſe, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe, comes directly to her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, where the Fire firſt took; One whole wing of her Houſe was burnt, in deſpite of all help could be brought. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> reviv'd from her ſwound, and he withdrew, the Servants had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired as much as poſſible the ſtrange diſorder cauſed by the Fire, but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhales</hi> Lodgings being quite burnt, they were forced to make ready for her ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chamber. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> cauſed the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Cloſet and Chamber to be ſearched for <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s Body, but all in vain. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> ſad and deſperate, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding her to take a Torch, would go her ſelf, to ſee if ſhe could not diſcover the unhappy remains of a Man ſhe had ſo dearly loved; but paſſing out of her Chamber, ſhe rejoyced to find him alive; he told her, that perceiving the Fire took
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94436:118"/>hold of the Cloſet, he choſe rather to leap into the Garden, then expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to what might have been talked, had he been ſeen paſs through the Chamber, which he could hardly have that way avoided. That being conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the darkneſs, he waited a time to get away undiſcerned, but when he thought he had found the opportunity, feared to be diſcovered by <hi>Ligneroles</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtiques, hindred him, and made him return back, that the Fire being quell'd and nigh far ſpent, not knowing how to get out of the Houſe, he ſought for <hi>L'Hermites</hi> Chamber, when now he met her. <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſaw her all in Tears, her Hair in diſorder, and only in her Night-Gown, but in that negligence ſhe diſcovered great Beauties, which ſtill inflamed his deſires.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who knew not the accident till it was late, returned to the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> aſſoon as ſhe heard it. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> brought <hi>Buſſy</hi> into a Wardrobe belonging to her chamber, and which on the other ſide, had a door into a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of Pictures, and put him into a great Preſs, leſt Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> ſhould ſee him. She condoled with the <hi>Mareſhale</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:94436:118"/>for her loſs, and judging ſhe would have but an ill night of it in that Chamber, preſſed her to go lodge with her. This propoſition pleaſed not <hi>Buſſy</hi> who heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to it, and he feared her accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the offer, had ſhe had his thoughts ſhe had ſtaid, but not able to withſtand the urgent intreaties of Madam <hi>Bonneval,</hi> ſhe conſented, and after having whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething to <hi>L'Hermite,</hi> goes into the Wardrobe, telling Madam <hi>Bonneval</hi> ſhe would immediately return: and <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> who by her Miſtreſs order, gave light but by halfs, being ready to open the Preſs, ſaw him juſt by her; deſerve what I have done for you by a kind and faithful paſſion; I love you, as you may perceive, ſaid ſhe to him, kiſſing him, and I beg you would not be gone. He was ſo ſurprized at the ſight and action of the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> that he could not riſe, he onely took one of her hands, and ſqueezing it between his, ſighed. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> at the ſame time was coming towards the Wardrobe, but <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> feigning to light better, lifting up the Candle, put it out againſt the door, ſhe run preſently to take another, which was on the Chamber-Table, and the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94436:119"/>
               <hi>Mareſhale</hi> fearing leſt Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> ſhould diſcover <hi>Buſſy,</hi> came to meet her juſt at the time the Candle was put out, and led her back to her chamber; <hi>L'Hermite</hi> bringing another lighted one. In ſhort, ſhe went to lodge with Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> leaving charge to <hi>L'Hermite</hi> to be careful that <hi>Buſſy</hi> might go out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived, which ſhe performed. Aſſoon as he was gone thence, he cauſed Horſes to be brought, parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> and by ſix aclock in the morning o'retook the Court at <hi>Eſtampes.</hi> The <hi>Mareſhales</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize at his departure, was ſo much the greater, becauſe ſhe believed ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained her thoughts to him in ſo kind a manner, as could not deſerve this Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. How cruelly was ſhe angry at her ſelf, for having been ſo yielding; ſhe reſolved to love him no more, but Love ſoon made her know, he is not ſo eaſily rid off, and that he is a ſort of guoſt not to be driven when one will, from that Heart he has once taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of.</p>
            <p>She askes <hi>L'Hermite,</hi> if <hi>Buſſy</hi> had ſaid nothing to her when he went, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood he had ſaid nothing, but ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed melancholly, and ſhe gueſt it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94436:119"/>by reaſon of Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> coming, and that not having expected her going to lodge with her, he could not undergo ſo cruel a diſappointment, without being extreamly afflicted.</p>
            <p>I told you that <hi>Buſſy</hi> left <hi>Neufville</hi> his truſty friend at <hi>Paris,</hi> he was to believe in Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and to agree with her in what manner they might beſt ſerve him with his Miſtriſs in his abſence, whom though <hi>Buſſy</hi> had offended in the tendreſt part of her ſoul, far from imitating his proceedings; ſhe continued to love him, and forgot not the leaſt duty of a kind and faithful Lover. Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> knew nothing of <hi>Buſſys</hi> being hid in the Cloſet and Wardrobe, but there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets Love keeps only for its ſelf.</p>
            <p>She now begins to put in practice the ingenious deſign ſhe had contrived to ruine the correſpondence between the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> and him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neufville</hi> was a Man proper for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he was young, handſome, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, but he had a Heart of Wax, and by that ſhe believed ſhe might revenge the ſcorn ſhe thought <hi>Buſſy</hi> had put upon her, when he gave <hi>Grillon</hi> that Letter and Bracelet ſhe had ſent only to himſelf.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94436:120"/>The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> who would not give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuſpect the reaſons ſhe had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of him, told them, that ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred him with delight, and that his abſence much more troubled her, then ever any Perſons did. Some true friends gave this account to <hi>Buſſy,</hi> but <hi>Neufvilles</hi> Love contradicted it as well as the Treaſon of Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who obſerving <hi>Neuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villes</hi> joy when he ſaw the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> and his Heavineſs when he parted from her, conceived it eaſie to make him a Lover, if already he were not. What is in your mind, ſaid ſhe to him, one day, that you doe not love; look upon the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> there is nothing ſo beautiful, you are an accompliſhed Perſon, and have deſert e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and why ſhould you be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to your ſelf; ſhe told him ſo many other fine things, that he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be ſeduced, and it muſt be added, that the ſweet and obliging carriage of the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> compleated his loſs by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him: thus he became unfaithful to his friend, but Love was his excuſe, and when he undertakes a juſtification, we are conſtrained to grant pardon to the moſt guilty.</p>
            <pb n="237" facs="tcp:94436:120"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Neufville</hi> then forgot all that he ought to the eſteem and friendſhip of <hi>Buſſy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that his paſſion ought to ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond its own ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ligneroles</hi> who ſtayed a day after his Rival, overtook not the Court till they came to <hi>Orleans,</hi> where a Feavor ſeized <hi>Chateauneuf.</hi> Its acceſſes not having been violent, <hi>Monſieur</hi> reſolved to go as far as <hi>Blois,</hi> but the next day the diſtemper doubling, ſhe was conſtrained to ſtay.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Love is forming theſe cruel vexations for <hi>Buſſy,</hi> Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> entruſts the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> with the whole ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of her commerce with <hi>Grillon.</hi> Love had ſome difficulty to enter her Heart that way, but at laſt he found a paſſage; her anger againſt <hi>Buſſy</hi> aſſiſted, and the diligence and conſtancy of <hi>Grillon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the reſt. How ſtand things, ſaid the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> to her; does he know you love him? I think he has no reaſon to doubt it, anſwered Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> I have writ to him, in a manner ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explaining my thoughts, and as we ſeldom forget things done for what we love, I believe I remember that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be thus.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SInce happy Lovers are never content, you cannot wonder if I complain, who am not ſo. 'Tis the property of Love ſtill to be asking, and I have never yet received ſo much from him, that I can think he deſerves thanks for his Preſents. But if he reſolve to make me any, let them come by your hands, all I can receive elſewhere, will bring little ſatisfaction, and without your goodneſs, I cannot but be unhappy, would you have me ſo?</hi>

            <p>No, doubtleſs he ſhall not be ſo, if his happineſs depends on me, purſued ſhe, returning again her Letter, his Deſert and Love have made a great progreſs in my Heart, and if I continue in this mind, I am perſwaded there will be many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lovers more to be pittied then he; what do we ſignify if we love not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Love there is no ſolid Pleaſure, and without that of what uſe is Life? we are ſoon tired with the conſtraints of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and by that we may find how cruel the Laws are to us, reducing us to extract our ſhame from the ſame Center whence Men draw ſubjects of Eſteem and Glory; but do you know what we ought to do? raiſe our ſelves above theſe ſorts of Laws, and Love, ſince nature has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us Hearts tender and ſenſible: That Sage-Mother would not have let us be born with ſuch ſtrong inclinations of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, unleſs ſhe had deſigned us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite with Love Mens Love to us? let us then follow the bent of our own Hearts, and believe that that Virtue which has ſo many pains and troubles for its guard, is only an endowment which Women unprovided of allurements of the Body, or charms of the Mind have maliciouſly
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94436:122"/>invented, to revenge the Scorn Nature has thrown on them, but we who have thanks to return to her, may tread in more pleaſant paths, and ſince Love is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the greateſt Virtues, is it not ſo always to do virtuouſly, ſo follow what it inſpires.</p>
            <p>This is, doubtleſs, moſt ſingular Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſaid the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> but who is it will begin the practice of it; there have ſome been found in all times, replyed Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and you and I ſhould do very prudently in following theſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes.</p>
            <p>'Twas thus, ſhe concluded, the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of her paſſion. The ſame day that the King arrived at <hi>Blois,</hi> where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty of Peace were at laſt decided, by which the <hi>Hugonots</hi> obtained the greateſt part of their deſires. The Marriage of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> was likewiſe agreed on, and a Courier ſent to <hi>Jane D'Albret,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to advertiſe her of it, and to preſs her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Blois,</hi> whither the Court was onely come for the eaſier accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the affairs of that Marriage and the Peace.</p>
            <pb n="241" facs="tcp:94436:122"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Monſieur</hi> went every other day to ſee <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> at <hi>Orleans;</hi> her Feavor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left her, ſhe was carried back to <hi>Paris</hi> by direction of the Phyſitians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> and <hi>Ligneroles</hi> led a ſad life at <hi>Blois,</hi> and the deſtiny of the happieſt was ſo averſe, that he believed himſelf moſt to be pittied and lamented. They were one evening in the Garden, but apart. <hi>Grillon</hi> was with <hi>Buſſy,</hi> to whom he was ſhowing a Letter he had received from Madam <hi>de Bonneval. Ligneroles</hi> who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alone, and was ſomewhat near them, ſeeing a Letter in <hi>Buſsy</hi>'s hands, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it came from the <hi>Mareſhale;</hi> If I could hate you, ſaid he, drawing towards him, I ſhould not be ſo unhappy, and perhaps the pleaſure of revenging my ſelf on a Rival that triumphs over me, would help me to ſupport with leſs grief, the cruelties of the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> There was, ſaid <hi>Buſſy,</hi> but one way, wherein I deſired to be Maſter; I hoped all from my Love, and from her I love, but you have deprived me of the only good, could make me happy, by telling me my happineſs makes you deſpair; you that are loved, you that know it, and to whom it has not only been told in my preſence, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94436:123"/>you have likewiſe received a favour which was only due to my love; alas, 'tis of that cruel favour I complain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> I am ſenſible it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for you, I was not uſed to be ſo treated, and had I had my choice, ſhould rather have been content with uſual and known rigors, then a moments kindneſs received from chance, and not from the heart of the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> Hitherto, ſaid <hi>Buſſy,</hi> interrupting, we have lived rather like Friends then Rivals, let us continue to do ſo; <hi>Grillon</hi> is not to be ſuſpected, we may freely ſpeak our thoughts before him. To ſhow you I approve what you ſay, replyed <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> I am about to tell you that not being able to reſolve on my departure without having ſome privacy with the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> I went to kiſs her hands that evening the fire took in her Lodgins. That accident ſo affrighted her, that ſhe ſwounded, but I ſuſpected not the true cauſe of it, till an hour after, I made a ſhow of being gone, and hid my ſelf. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> came to ſearch among the ruines of the Chamber, and I thought I heard her name you. I gueſs'd it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but you might be ſtayed at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the Lady <hi>Mareſhales</hi> houſe, though
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94436:123"/>you were believed to be gone. Alas, I was but too certain of it, ſome time after I ſaw come forth the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> with <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi> who told her there was no doubt to be made but you periſhed in the Flames of the Cloſet; her Tears affected me, and I was juſt about to diſcover my ſelf when you appeared, and ſeeking a place to hide my ſelf, turned back into a Chamber, and ſate me down neer a Preſs. What could I think of your return, and of the kindneſs of the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> when ſhe came up to me? Ah <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> ſaid <hi>Buſſy,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, tell me not that I wiſh I had never known: then he related to him all had happened with her; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his thughts concerning <hi>Grillons</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, prayed him to ſhow the Character, but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> would not ſee it, <hi>Buſſy</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſſured him, that it was not from the <hi>Mareſhale;</hi> having thus cleared their ſuſpitions, they parted with ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Eſteem and Friendſhip, that <hi>Grillon</hi> was amazed to think how Rivals could live in ſuch good intelligence, but theſe were no common Men.</p>
            <p>'Twas now Bathing-time. <hi>Buſsy</hi> who was preſcribed it, went every night; ſo did the King and moſt part of the Court.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94436:124"/>He ſcarce knew how to ſwim, but truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his little cunning, ventured out of his depth, and the ſtream carried him away; he ſtrove againſt it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to regain the ſhore, but all his ſtriving was in vain; in the end he grew weaker and weaker, breath and motion failed him, and he was ready to ſink to the bottom, when a Man ſwimming with skill and ſtrength, div'd ſo luckily after him, that in a moment he roſe again holding <hi>Buſſy.</hi> Every one cryed out aſſoon as they perceived the danger, but 'twas <hi>Ligneroles</hi> outſtript all that would have ſaved him, and repaid <hi>Buſſy</hi> the ſuccor he had once given him. He was carried home, having ſcarce any ſence, and 'twas <hi>Grillon</hi> told him how <hi>Ligneroles</hi> had ſaved him; he came to him ſoon after, and what they ſaid, was worthy of what they had done the one for the other. The Court had then reſolved to depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two days for <hi>Borgueil,</hi> though <hi>Buſſy</hi> was not in a condition to goe within thoſe two days, yet he would have followed it, but <hi>Ligneroles</hi> and <hi>Grillon</hi> oppoſed it.</p>
            <p>His Grief was not ſo great to hinder the thinking of his Love; The <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhale</hi> was innocent, he had offended her
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94436:124"/>in coming away againſt her Orders, and without telling the cauſe, and had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writ to Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> nor to <hi>Neufville,</hi> he reſolved to go aſſoon as he was recovered, and repair his fault with ſo much ſervice, that ſhe ſhould loſe the memory of it.</p>
            <p>With his hopes in a ſhort time to ſee the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> there grew up a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly he could not ſuppreſs; <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was the cauſe of it, his Merits, his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Thoughts, and the greatneſs of his Soul; all troubled him; not that he had not a Rival he might hate, but that he had a friend, whom he was not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſerve and make happy. Theſe ſad thoughts were his entertainers one morning, when <hi>Grillon</hi> came back to <hi>Blois,</hi> and told him, <hi>Ligneroles</hi> was killed as he was Hunting, and that within five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces of the King. The grief he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at his death is not to be imagined; he would have riſen, and returned to the Court, made open complaints, and thrown out reproches and threats, but what would they have done? are the Great obliged to give an account of their actions? or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it not with their intereſt and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to puniſh Pride and Inſolence? The
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94436:125"/>King would doubtleſs have chaſtis'd this in <hi>Buſſy,</hi> had he had the boldneſs to ſpeak, but <hi>Grillons</hi> good Counſels hindred his going, and on the morrow he went with him towards <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> made uſe of <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s abſence, ſhe omitted no occaſion of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his carriage and forgetfulneſs. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> for the moſt part heard her, but without anſwering her, and made her judge by her manner of acting, that ſhe was kind and conſtant; her cunning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming fruitleſs on the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> part, ſhe attempted to ſucceed by <hi>Neufvilles,</hi> who aſſiſted but two much with his love; all being fittingly diſpoſed for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by her contrived, ſhe ſends an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to <hi>Grillon</hi> with Letters which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Orleans,</hi> after <hi>Ligneroles</hi> death was known at <hi>Paris;</hi> at which the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhale</hi> was very lively afflicted, but had the ſatisfaction to know that ſhe could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone grieve his death, whom all the world lamented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> received a Letter by <hi>Grillon</hi> from Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> which gave him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the infidelity of the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had made <hi>Grillon</hi> read it, what ſhall I do, ſaid he? this unlooked for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94436:125"/>over-whelms me, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am, I know not what to reſolve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grillon</hi> ſeemed at firſt as troubled as he, but at length counſelled him to make haſt to <hi>Paris,</hi> and above all things convince himſelf of the matter. <hi>Buſſy</hi> approved <hi>Grillons</hi> advice, and ſent back the Expreſs empty: Being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who was content with <hi>Grillons</hi> love, received him like a lover ſhe bated not, and he appeared not unworthy her reception. However, though ſhe gave him a thouſand teſtimonies of her truſt and kindneſs, yet ſhe never let him know either her anger or deſign of revenge on <hi>Buſſy;</hi> ſhe ſpoke of him with eſteem, ſhe ſeemed earneſt to ſerve him, and it was ſhe had adviſed him of his Miſtreſs trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. We are leſs ſenſible of any affront, then that committed againſt our love. That offence is moſt cruel, and he that receives it without deſerving it, has ſtrange griefs to undergo. In the midſt of all theſe perplexities his love ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; and the inclinations of his heart told him ſufficiently, that he muſt ſtill love, though he knew himſelf forſaken. Then thinking of his unknown Rival, who had ſnatched from him what had
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94436:126"/>coſt him ſo much to ſeek after, fain would he have found out who this happy man ſhould be, but would never have gueſt <hi>Neufville,</hi> whom he believed his friend, tell he was diſabuſed the next morning, when Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> made <hi>Grillon</hi> tell him, ſhe deſired to ſpeak with him. He came at the hour appointed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtopping at the unneceſſary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this interview, I will onely tell you, that ſhe hid <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and that ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Neufville</hi> entred, he had a Black Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Suit, Embroidered with Silk of the ſame, and between ſpace and ſpace might be ſeen double <hi>L L</hi> in Embroidery of Pearls. <hi>Buſſy</hi> at firſt ſight, gueſt not what thoſe Cifers meant, but he ſoon found out they were the <hi>Mareſhales,</hi> who was of the Houſe of <hi>Luſtrac.</hi> She was not long ere ſhe came, and Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> feigning to order her head tire at the Glaſs, <hi>Buſſy</hi> over-heard the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> ſay to <hi>Neufville,</hi> I fear leaſt you undertake to pleaſe me, you muſt ſucceed in it; your manners are ſo obliging, you are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and complaiſant, and have ſo much eſtimable merit, that I fear I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt it. Change your procedure, it is too winning, and know that I will not
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94436:126"/>be affected. Theſe words were pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a delicate mouth, and the faireſt eyes in the World glanced favorably on <hi>Neufville,</hi> and <hi>Buſſy</hi> believed all this due onely to his love. Have no care nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance for me, continued ſhe, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me before all other Ladies, nor ſhall I be ſo weak to love you for it. How happy was <hi>Neufville?</hi> And how deſperate grew <hi>Buſſy?</hi> He was in the mind to come forth and upbraid the perfidiouſneſs of his Friend and Miſtreſs; but knowing that it is love always makes reproaches and complaints, he withdrew, without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the remainder of their diſcourſe, which he believed he could not quietly liſten to. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> knew not of his return, no more then did <hi>Neufville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About twenty paces from the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhales, Buſſy</hi> met <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> who deſirous to know ſome news from the Court, and to tell him that <hi>Neufville</hi> was his Rival, carried him to the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> whither he had deſigned to go. Whilſt he walked two turns with her, he gave her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of all ſhe deſired to know, and told her ſo reſpectively, that he would never love, that ſhe had not the power to complain of a Man ſhe could not hate.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94436:127"/>In vain would ſhe have diſſwaded him from loving the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> he remained conſtant, though he thought himſelf not obliged to do ſo.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Neufville</hi> was parted from Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> Houſe, the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> and ſhe came to the <hi>Tuilleries;</hi> they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> at a great diſtance, and the nigher they drew, the more Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> obliged the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> to obſerve, that the man was with her did much reſemble <hi>Buſſy.</hi> She granted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, but could hardly believe ſhe ſaw him, till <hi>Buſſy</hi> and <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> turned towards them; the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> bluſhed at the ſight of her lover, he paſſed by her with much reſpect, and could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear looking after her; but he ſpoke not, and continued his walk with <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> whoſe deſign was to increaſe the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> grief, put her in mind how ſhe would not believe her, when ſhe had formerly told her <hi>Buſſy</hi> loved <hi>Chateauneuf.</hi> Ingrateful Man, ſaid ſhe to her, do you ſee in what manner he treats you; after all this, can you love him? to be in <hi>Paris</hi> without ſeeing you, and publickly ſacrifice your love at the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94436:127"/>feet of your Rival. Alaſs, ſaid ſhe, I feel all you can inſtil into me, but let me ſuffer and complain, I have no need of your Counſels, and will onely follow the dictates of my own heart. <hi>Buſſy</hi> at his return home, told <hi>Grillon</hi> all he had ſeen and heard at Madam <hi>de Bonnevals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So great a cauſe of deſpair in ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a Paſſion, the Treaſon of the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhale,</hi> and the death of <hi>Ligneroles,</hi> infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed him, and created ſufferings he could hardly undergo; ſometimes he was reſolved to love no more, but to ſeek in a quiet Retreat, the Remedy of ſo many Griefs. <hi>Grillon</hi> told him, that was to yield the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> to <hi>Neufville,</hi> and that he ought to make her return, either for glory or for loves ſake, but he was too incenſed to follow this advice.</p>
            <p>Some days after, the Court arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> with the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who joyned it at what time it was at <hi>Bloys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ties of Friendſhip and Intereſt which had formerly been between the late King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the <hi>Mareſhale de St. Andre</hi> had made her have a great eſteem for his Perſon after his death; ſhe had preſerved for the <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> the ſame thoughts ſhe had had for her Husband,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94436:128"/>ſhe Commanded her to ſee her often, and had no cauſe to blame her neglects, for that ſhe ſeldom was from that Queen, but ſhared in all her divertiſements and all her pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Medices</hi> mortally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her; ſhe knew that <hi>Jean</hi> of <hi>Albret</hi> had remonſtrated to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that he might be choſen Head of that Faction divided <hi>France,</hi> if he knew how to make uſe of the occaſion of taking the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into his hands. If this counſel had been executed with as much boldneſs as was given with judgement, <hi>Catherine de Medices</hi> had been no longer Miſtrifs of affairs; ſhe could not live without ruling; but the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> being too mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and ſuffering himſelf to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the paſſion he had for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle de Roy,</hi> who was gained by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine de Medices,</hi> he yielded to her what he could not keep. This was the true foundation of that hate, ended not but with the death of <hi>Jean</hi> of <hi>Albret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> was gone to <hi>Chantilly</hi> to viſit the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> then returned from <hi>England,</hi> whither he had been ſent to hinder Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> from giving aſſiſtance to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> by propoſing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94436:128"/>a Match with the Duke <hi>D'Alanzon Buſſy</hi> ſtaid there two days, during which came the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> under pretence of ſeeing his fine Houſe, but indeed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in the intereſts of the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the better to oppoſe the hatred and Authority of <hi>Katherine,</hi> who in the ruines of the greateſt Men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would not ſpare the <hi>Montmorency</hi>'s, whom ſhe ever hated, both becauſe of their uprightneſs, and becauſe they would not abaſe themſelves, to depend direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on her power.</p>
            <p>The Duke civilly received the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> but would not enter into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Treaty with her, though ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore not afterwards to give other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations to the conference he had with this Queen; and had not he prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained at <hi>Chantilly</hi> during the King of <hi>Navarr's</hi> Wedding, he had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly enveloped on that diſmal <hi>St. Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomews</hi> day, which coſt <hi>France</hi> ſo much blood.</p>
            <p>The Duke treated her with all the Magnificence ſhe could expect from a great King. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> was with her, ſtill fair, but Languiſhing and negligent of her ſelf. <hi>Catherine de Medices</hi> not able
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94436:129"/>to ſuffer the Imperious humour, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Courage, and the Conſtancy of <hi>Jeane d'Albret,</hi> and her hatred making her take cruel reſolutions, ſhe ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put them in execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s Merits were well known, though he had not yet that great repute he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gained; There were then few men of <hi>France</hi> had ſo much Wit, Valour, or good Mien as he: The Duke <hi>de Montmorency</hi> preſented him to the Queen, ſhe received him ſo kindly that he was compelled to ſtay at <hi>Chantilly,</hi> though he were reſolved to return to <hi>Paris;</hi> beſides the entreaties of the Duke, and the ſight of his Miſtreſs abating his deſire of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſoon, he the eaſier conſented to ſtay.</p>
            <p>There was in <hi>Chantilly</hi> a Hall and a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet of Armes, whither the Conſtable <hi>Anne de Montmorency</hi> had cauſed to be brought from all Europe, what could moſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embelliſh them with what ever was rich or rare. Above all theſe things was in eſteem a Scimitar ſet with Diamonds and Emeralds, which the Grand Signor <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> had ſent him, together with a Hanger or Dagger all adorned with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies; The Queen, curious to ſee all the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94436:129"/>ſeveral Rooms and Magnificent Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which adorned them, paſſed into this Hall of Armes, and thence into the Cloſet, where ſhe was ſhowed that Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thought beyond all vallue, both for the Stones which enriched it, and for its workmanſhip, which added to its beauty and Ornament.</p>
            <p>After it had been in the Queens and ſome other hands, the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> would ſee it, and having ſufficiently admired it, <hi>Buſſy</hi> not being far from her, having obſerved his ſtand, ſhe went towards him, and drawing out the Dagger, and ſetting it with a threatning look to his breſt, <hi>To what uſe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>ought this to be deſtin'd: To pierce the moſt faithleſs of all hearts,</hi> ſaid he, taking the point and turning it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Mareſhale:</hi> This Anſwer ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed her, and ſhe expected not ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, who could not believe ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it. <hi>Ah Buſſy</hi> (replyed ſhe in a doleful accent) <hi>there was never a more faithleſs— then yours, Madam</hi> (ſaid he, interrupting her) They were entring into a Diſcourſe had not been ſoon finiſh'd, but the Queen going out of the Cloſet called the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> who accompanyed her Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> was not at <hi>Chantilly;</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:94436:130"/>the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> had intreated her to go, and <hi>Grillon</hi> had deſired her to ſtay at <hi>Paris;</hi> thus the Friend was refuſed, and the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had his requeſt. Was not this very juſt? they could never before converſe with ſo much Love as they had a deſire to do. <hi>Grillon</hi> now paſſed one part of the day with her, the Lady was tender, in ſhort, they ſaid a thouſand things were never told. This entertainment being on their own private account, and they being diſcreet Lovers, all that paſſed could never be known; but, it may be judged they treated of nothing leſs then indifferency, and the curious have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that they received often theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, and that if Love had not been mixed with them, they had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much delight in talking without witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Was not Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> too hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? ſhe was beloved by one of the honeſteſt men of <hi>France;</hi> ſhe had by her cunning betray'd her Friend, made <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi> unhappy in ſtead of doing him Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as ſhe had promiſed; ſhe fears not the penalties, treaſon and perfidiouſneſs deſerve; ſhe triumphs o're the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> and <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and when
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94436:130"/>ſhe is with <hi>Grillon</hi> forgets all the World, the better to think of her Love.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> and <hi>Buſſy</hi> found often at <hi>Chantilly</hi> opportunities of talking; but the <hi>Mareſhales</hi> fierceneſs, and <hi>Buſſyes</hi> ſhame and anger to be forſaken, hindred them from uttering what they even died with a deſire of ſpeaking. Thus each had their grief and affliction. <hi>Buſſy,</hi> that to find the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> more lovely, ſince he believed her falſe; The <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in <hi>Buſſy</hi> a ſadneſs which had very much changed his countenance.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> returned on the morrow to <hi>Paris,</hi> but <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſtaid yet one day with the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he returned to Court: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every day more and more in Love, and the beauty of the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> made him forget the infidelity he thought her guilty of.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> continued ſtill ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lady <hi>Mareſhale,</hi> that is to ſay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her. <hi>L'Hermite</hi> told her judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it was not well received, and ſhe was ſilent. <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſeldome ſaw Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> ſhe complained to <hi>Grillon</hi> that he might tell him, but he had no more an inclination towards her; he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94436:131"/>looked upon her as the cauſe of her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune without ſuſpecting her Treaſon, and he could have wiſhed never to have heard the perſon he loved pronounce words in favour of another; but, the thing was done, he had ſeen, he had heard, Can he any longer doubt?</p>
            <p>So many cauſes of ſorrow in a paſſion ſo tenderly preſerved, tormented him beyond a power of enduring; ſo that he was often in the mind to quit utterly his love, and ſilently retreat from the World.</p>
            <p>The Soul of the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> was toſſed with no leſs violent ſtorms, ſhe was loth to loſe <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and ſhe gave ſufficient aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of it one evening that ſhe found him at the Queen of <hi>Navarr</hi>'s. She was reſolved to know if he yet loved her, and made uſe of an ingenuous feigned device to diſcover his thoughts. <hi>Will</hi> Buſſy <hi>refuſe to ſerve me</hi> (ſaid ſhe.) <hi>I ſhould</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>but I cannot, I have loved you too well. Ah 'tis not that which I deſire,</hi> (replyed ſhe interrupting him) <hi>come to me to morrow and you ſhall know what I have to ſay.</hi> She had time to ſay no more by reaſon of the arrival of Madam, who beginning to fancy ſome intereſt in <hi>Buſſy,</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:94436:131"/>obſerved nicely all his actions. On the morrow going towards the <hi>Mareſhales,</hi> he paſſed by Madam <hi>de Bonnevals,</hi> where he ſaw <hi>Neufville</hi> enter; <hi>L'Hermite</hi> had order to make <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſtay, ſhe told him his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs dined at Madam <hi>de Bonnevals,</hi> and that ſhe would return immediately.</p>
            <p>He was about to go and ſurprize the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> and <hi>Neufville,</hi> and to load them with a thouſand reproaches; but <hi>L'Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> who underſtood the moſt part of his melancholy hindred his going out: In ſhort, the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> ſoon returned, ſhe would not ſee <hi>Neufville,</hi> but had left him in the hands of Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> who too officiouſly preſſed her to hear what he would ſay.</p>
            <p>Being then alone in her Chamber with <hi>Buſſy; Though all treaty of love be for ever ended between us</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>yet I have ſo great an eſteem for you as to aske your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Will you give it me? Buſſy</hi> promiſed it, and ſhe proceeded thus. <hi>Since I have loſt all hopes of being beloved by you, I think it may be permitted me to engage in another violent paſſion which may laſt all my life, my heart whiſpers me in favour of</hi> Neufville, <hi>he is worthy of love, he loves me, What do you counſel me? To hearken to all that your
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94436:132"/>heart dictates Madam</hi> (reply'd <hi>Buſſy</hi>) <hi>and to give your ſelf wholly to</hi> Neufville. <hi>But if I love him</hi> (reply'd ſhe) <hi>if I have given him markes of it, and if I do all I can to perſwade him that no one can be more beloved than I do him, Will you have no regret for what you loſe. What matter whether I am unhappy or deſperate</hi> (reply'd he) <hi>you may love, you may be happy, and you may have the pleaſure never more to remember</hi> Buſſy: <hi>follow, follow your own thoughts Madam, and never think of thoſe cruel torments you make me undergo. Ah Ingrateful Man,</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Mareſhale</hi>) <hi>Will you forſake me then? you that have made me ſo ſenſible, Can you Counſel me to give my ſelf to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? You have done it already</hi> (ſaid <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> interrupting her and ſighing) <hi>and I have known but too well how dearly you love</hi> Neufville. <hi>Is it poſſible that you can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me in the leaſt</hi> (reply'd ſhe) <hi>you who went hence for the progreſs in deſpite of that kindneſs of mine to requeſt your ſtay? Ah</hi> Ligneroles (cry'd Buſſy) <hi>How happy were you at that time, and how did I envy the delights you then enjoyed?</hi> He told the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> in what manner ſhe had been deceiv'd, ſhe bluſht at what ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from <hi>Buſſy,</hi> and the confuſion
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94436:132"/>ſhe appeared in made her yet ſeem fairer.</p>
            <p>In ſum, he told her he could no longer doubt her being falſe, that he ſaw her at Madam <hi>Bonnevals</hi> with <hi>Neufville,</hi> and heard her ſay to him a thouſand kind and obliging things. The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> fell a Laughing at this diſcourſe, <hi>Buſsy</hi> grew an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and would have been gone, when <hi>Neufville</hi> entred the room, whatever <hi>L'Hermite</hi> could do to hinder him, and though the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> had forbid his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; He looked pale, and grief and repentance ſeemed lively repreſented in his Countenance: Having demanded only the favour of Audience from the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> and <hi>Buſſy,</hi> it was granted him, and he ſpoke thus. <hi>Had I not been aſſist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preſsed forward to become ſo guilty, I had never betrayed either the truſt or friendſhip of</hi> Buſſy, <hi>or have dared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my Love; but, Madam, will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, 'twas Madam</hi> de Bonneval <hi>who counſelled me to love you, and to tell you ſo, thence had my crime its ſpring; your inchanting carriage, your charming features, and in ſhort all your Beauties brought it into a Stream.</hi> The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> who had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> could ſcarce
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94436:133"/>believe this perfidiouſneſs; but <hi>Buſſy</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pul'd out of his pocket a Letter which ſhe had writ for his return, ſhe could no longer be doubtful of her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, after having read her words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>REturn.</hi> Buſſy, <hi>the</hi> Mareſhales <hi>conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſtands in need of you: Her heart is aſſaulted in one of its moſt ſenſible places, I know it, and know ſhe cannot viſit. You have a Rival thought too lovely, his ſight in one moment deſtroyes all that ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for your paſſion. How unhappy are men to have ſo much Love for ungrateful Women.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>She well knew the Character to be Madam <hi>de Bonnevals,</hi> and withal remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how ſhe had ſtill endeavoured to divert her from loving <hi>Buſsy,</hi> ſhe began to ſearch the cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Will you tell me the truth</hi> (ſaid ſhe to him) <hi>Did Madam</hi> de Bonneval <hi>never love you? poſſibly ſome refuſal you made of her heart, has made her attempt revenge on yours. I know nothing certainly Madam</hi> (ſaid he, after having thought a little while on what ſhe had ſaid) <hi>but I have ſome ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you may poſſibly help me to give ſome
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94436:133"/>light to.</hi> He then began to tell her of the requeſt <hi>Grillon</hi> had made to him, to ſerve him with Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> in what manner it was performed, and the interruption given by <hi>Madame</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaneuf;</hi> and, that on the morrow ſhe ſent the Note and the hair Bracelet, which he carried to <hi>Grillon.</hi> There needs no more ſaid the <hi>Mareſhale:</hi> The cauſe of <hi>Bonnevals</hi> hate is plain, ſhe applyed to your ſelf what you ſaid for <hi>Grillon,</hi> and <hi>Grillon</hi> doubtleſs received a favour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for you: In the end, ſhe would juſtifie her ſelf, concerning thoſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand kind things <hi>Buſsy</hi> had heard her ſay to <hi>Neufville,</hi> aſſuring them to be cauſed by Madam <hi>de Bonnevals</hi> artifice, and that ſhe had engaged her to ſpeak ſo to <hi>Neuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> to diſcover if he were truly in Love with her, by counſelling, that if it were ſo, to command his abſence, that <hi>Buſſy</hi> might have no cauſe of complaint at his return. He underſtood as well as the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> that he had unhappily contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to make the Treaſon ſucceed, and that Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> had managed all things ſo well, that any other as well as he would have believed her the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful woman living. <hi>Neufville</hi> heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94436:134"/>and could not but be amazed to hear how farr Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> had carry'd her lies and treachery, when the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> prayed him to let <hi>Buſſy</hi> know how ſhe had finiſh'd that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, of which as he had told her, he had heard the beginning. <hi>Imagine</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>what pleaſure I had to hear ſuch kind and charming words pronounced in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for, Who had ever the like ſaid to them? I hoped, and I dare ſay I believed I was beloved; but, How great was my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair? when, after having acknowledged I was in Love. Ingrateful and moſt perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious man that you are</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>going away from me; Is it thus that you ſerve,</hi> Buſſy? <hi>Love will not permit me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>and I obey his commands. Let me never ſee you more</hi> (ſaid ſhe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me) <hi>It begets a horrour in me to behold ſuch unworthy proceedings in a man of Honour.</hi> At theſe words ſhe turned to reproach Madam <hi>de Bonneval,</hi> and I withdrew in confuſion and deſpair. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this cruel adventure Madam,</hi> (proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Neufville</hi>) <hi>Repentance for having offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and done ſo great an injury to</hi> Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyes <hi>friendſhip, threw me into ſuch deep af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, that could I but tell one part of it,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94436:134"/>you would poſſibly have the generoſity to pardon me. I came to Madam</hi> Bonnevals <hi>with intent to beg it, you avoided ſeeing or ſpeaking with me, and I am come hither to tell you all this. 'Tis my fault</hi> (ſaid <hi>Buſſy,</hi> interrupting him) <hi>I ought not to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted you to take care of my concernes. I might eaſily have underſtood it, becauſe what I feel in ſeeing you Madam</hi> (ſaid he, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards her with a look full of love and kindneſs) <hi>muſt be likewiſe felt by others; Could</hi> Neufville <hi>anſwer otherwiſe then he did, when you ſpoke ſo kindly, let us forget his fault, and lament his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; for my part I will never ſpy out in him any other qualities than thoſe of a Friend, without ever remembring that he has been my rival, and that he may yet be ſo.</hi> The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> yielded to what <hi>Buſſy</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; his mind forgave <hi>Neufville,</hi> and permitted him to viſit her: At this, one came for him from the Queen of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> to whom <hi>Byron</hi> gave a Treat at the <hi>Arſenal.</hi> And <hi>Buſſy</hi> and <hi>Neufville</hi> went together to the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after to the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> where Madam <hi>de Bonneval</hi> ſaw plainly that the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> had diſcovered her Treacheries, as well by a biting reproach ſhe made her as by
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94436:135"/>the good intelligence ſhe obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Buſſy</hi> and <hi>Neufville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She eaſily allayed this misfortune with <hi>Grillons</hi> love, and that remedy ſeeming to her very ſweet and very pleaſant, ſhe took good care to apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buſſy</hi> was now free from all Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, Trouble and Rivalſhip: He was in Love, he was Beloved; What could he more deſire? One great delight he yet wanted, which his Love made him hope for, and which he reſolved to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. On the other ſide, the <hi>Mareſhale</hi> had retrieved her Lover, ſhe loved him, and thoſe that Love can refuſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>During the Collation they ſpoke a thouſand things by looks, which their hearts underſtood; but, this is not enough for true Lovers, there are yet greater pleaſures; they had both the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and the ſame deſires, and they were both perſwaded they ſhould find an infinite joy in their firſt Entertainment, and that then they ſhould find a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the ſo many griefs they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by Suſpitions, Abſence, Anger, and ſuppoſed Infidelities: They wanted but opportunity to make them happy; but,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94436:135"/>this happy opportunity came, and 'twas Love that brought it.</p>
            <p>'Twas about this time <hi>Madame</hi> was to marry the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and nothing wanted but the arrival of a diſpenſation to compleat the affair. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> loved her, but ſhe anſwered not his Love again, and <hi>Buſſy</hi> was beloved without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. He ſtill received ſome favourable glance from that Princeſs; ſhe bluſht when ever ſhe ſaw him, and he obſerved ſhe delighted to converſe with him. He knew himſelf in love, and doubted not her capable to be one day as much, he often ſhun'd her glances, and as often avoided her preſence. Thoſe that love truly, act thus, They are neither pleaſed, nor deſire any perſon but that they love. And 'twas this made <hi>Buſſy</hi> deſign to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the <hi>Maraſhale</hi> in her chamber, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting her have notice. She was in a charming negligence, <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſaw her, and <hi>Buſſy</hi> was in love, and alone. Whence comes it, ſaid ſhe, That I have ſuch a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on my Spirit, and that all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my Heart are ſo favourable to you? 'Tis becauſe you love me Madam, replyed he, and that you could not ſee me have ſo much love without following me in ſo
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:94436:136"/>fair a path. There is your queſtion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, proceeded he, caſting at her glances full of Love and Eloquence, which ſo well expreſs what the Tongue is not able to utter.</p>
            <p>But I have another more amorous queſtion to ask you, 'tis for your Wits, your Heart, and your Experience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve ſuch difficulties, and the deciſion you ſhall give, is ſo important, that on it depends our happineſs.</p>

               <hi>Buſsy</hi>'s Queſtion to the Lady <hi>Mareſhale.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which I would know from you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is; Whether Love, that ingenious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer of the moſt voluptuous Delights, has nothing beyond Looks and Words. Some Pleaſures and Tranſports which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Thoughts I am in, that it conſiſts not only in the Sight and Diſcourſe.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Mareſhale</hi> bluſht at the queſtion he would have her decide, but when her bluſhing and confuſion were ſuppreſſed by what ſhe inwardly felt, ſhe made this anſwer.</p>

            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beyond Looks and Words to uſe your own terms, I find a confuſed mixture of impreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Pleaſure and Love. It is made up of all theſe—I know not well how to decide your queſtion,</hi> proceeded ſhe; <hi>My Heart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learnt, what it has now told you: but I had it from a friend of mine, to whom all the delicacy of this paſſion was a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Virtue, and not from my ſelf, who am leſs knowing and experienced then ſhe.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Madam, ſaid <hi>Buſſy,</hi> interrupting her, <hi>Since your ſelf know not whether the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have made, be juſt, let us eſſay by a ſweet Tryal of our deſires to find out a truth we cannot doubt of:</hi> he ended theſe words with a kiſs, ſhe made at firſt ſome reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with deſign only to enflame his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; but in the end, fearing to offend his kindneſs, ſhe attempted to give <hi>Buſſy</hi> an amorous and ready revenge for his kiſſes, and that ſhe might not appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, ſhe returned them with uſury, and neither the one nor the other would have the laſt kiſs. The <hi>Mareſhales</hi> Eyes were more ſweet and languiſhing then uſual, and ſeemed to invite <hi>Buſſy</hi> to treat of the moſt endearing myſteries of <hi>Love,</hi> In this very moment her chaſtity began to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94436:137"/>yield to the violences of her Lovers paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but alas! can any one believe the cruel deſtiny of this amiable Perſon. Her Face was on a ſuddain painted with a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal colour, <hi>Buſſy</hi> perceived it, and called <hi>L'Hermite</hi> to her aſſiſtance, but all reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies could be applyed were in vain, ſhe died within an hour after in <hi>Buſſy</hi>'s Arms. Her death was diverſly ſpoken of, but when within three days after happened that of the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Florentine Gloves were ſuſpected, and in the clearing thoſe ſuſpitions, it was found that the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> had given a pair of thoſe Gloves to the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> In ſo diſmal an adventure <hi>Buſſy</hi> could not leave the Body of the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhale,</hi> he lamented in ſo feeling a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that his ſorrow ſeemed almoſt as grievous as the death of the <hi>Mareſhale.</hi> He had loſt the faireſt Perſon in <hi>France,</hi> juſt at the point of being happy, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair was violent and laſting, but yet he died not; what he did we may hereafter tell you.</p>
